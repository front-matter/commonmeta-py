        Open Mouse</a>, <em>The Loom</em>, May 24, 2007.&nbsp; Excerpt:</p> <blockquote>
        <p>[This] is also a chance to add my two cents to a discussion that''s been
        bubbling for a few weeks: the clash between bloggers and scientific journal
        publishers. Last month Shelley Batts at <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle\">Retrospectacle</a>
        wrote a post about a paper, and included a chart that appeared in it. She
        promptly got a letter from Wiley, the journal''s publisher, <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/when_fair_use_isnt_fair_1.php\">menacing
        her with legal action</a> unless she took the chart down. A <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/seed/2007/04/blogging_and_fair_use.php\">long
        discussion then unfolded</a> about fair use, a concept so mystical that I
        get a headache every time I try to figure out whether it applies to some text
        or image I''d like to use in my own work. Once the controversy reached Boing-Boing
        proportions, Wiley sent Batts a note telling her that <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/retrospectacle/2007/04/victory_a_happy_resolution.php\">it
        was all a big misunderstanding</a> and that they \"would typically grant permission
        on request in order to ensure that figures and extracts are properly credited.\"</p>
        <p>For us science writers, there''s a huge irony to this episode. Scientific
        journals like attention. The better-funded ones will go to great lengths to
        get stories written about their papers. They offer us science writers elaborately
        appointed press packages offering sneak peeks at papers coming out in the
        near future. They sometimes give us the cell phones of the authors of those
        papers, in case we need to call them in the middle of the night....  <p>But
        scientific journals also cling to conventions that block the news from spreading
        --particularly through the online world. Wiley, for example, initially reacted
        to Shelley not with enthusiasm, but with a menacing note. When Shelley responded
        by politely asking for permission, she was told to contact another person
        at Wiley. And when Wiley finally sort-of apologized, they still expected Shelley
        to jump through conventional hoops to get permission. All this kerfuffle over
        a little graph. It might have taken days to get permission to reprint it,
        which in the blogosphere is a geological era. Wiley was, consciously or unconsciously,
        going out of their way to squash interest in their papers.  <p>Compare Shelley''s
        experience to what I''m about to do. I''m going to --shudder-- reprint a diagram
        from a journal. Just lift it straight out.... <p>[<em>PS:&nbsp; Omitting chart
        and discussion of it.</em>]  <p>[The chart is from] <a href=\"http://genetics.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020114\">a
        paper they published last summer in the journal PLOS Genetics</a>....  <p>And
        what do I now hear from PLOS? Do I hear the grinding of lawyerly knives?&nbsp;
        No. I hear the blissful silence of Open Access, a slowly-spreading trend in
        the journal world.&nbsp; PLOS makes it very clear on their web site that <a
        href=\"http://www.plos.org/oa/index.html\">\"everything we publish is freely
        available online throughout the world, for you to read, download, copy, distribute,
        and use (with attribution) any way you wish.\"</a> No muss, no fuss. If I
        want to blog about this paper right now, I can grab a relevant image right
        now from it. In fact, I just did.  <p>I certainly appreciate the importance
        of copyrights (as the owner of many for my articles and books), but in these
        situations, keeping information behind a thick wall starts to seem a bit crazy,
        like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekw3XVq1uHs\">the loss of precious
        bodily fluids</a>. Far from committing some sort of violation to the PLOS
        paper, I have actually just spread the word about it. A few readers may even
        go back to read the original. And it was so easy and straightforward for me
        to do so that I will be very reluctant to bother with anything else. </p></blockquote>
