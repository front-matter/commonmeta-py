        of roles also allows us to analyze in greater detail how blog-related collaborations
        occur among members of our community. With this information, we can explore
        different ways to encourage participation for those interested, including
        how to best provide the support needed for successful participation.</p><p>We
        also hope that our findings will be useful to other communities in identifying
        different types of contributions and ways of giving credit.</p><p>Further
        work will include having more of those contributions featured in our feed
