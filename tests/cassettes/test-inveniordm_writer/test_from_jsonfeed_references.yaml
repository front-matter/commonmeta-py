        for DataCite in the European Commission-funded <a href=\"http://project-thor.eu/\">THOR
        project</a>, which started in June, was to contribute to a comparison of the
        ORCID and DataCite metadata standards. Together with ORCID, CERN, the British
        Library and Dryad we looked at how contributors, organizations and artefacts
        - and the relations between them - are described in the respective metadata
        schemata, and how they are implemented in two example data repositories, <a
        href=\"http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/\">Archaeology Data Service</a>
        and <a href=\"https://www.datadryad.org/\">Dryad Digital Repository</a>.</p><p>The
        focus of our work was on identifying major gaps. Our report was finished and
        made publicly available last week (Fenner et al., <a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/differences-between-orcid-and-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799\">2015</a>).
        The key findings are summarized below:</p><ul><li>Common Approach to Personal
        Names</li><li>Standardized Contributor Roles</li><li>Standardized Relation
        Types</li><li>Metadata for Organisations</li><li>Persistent Identifiers for
        Projects</li><li>Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata</li></ul><h3
        id=\"common-approach-to-personal-names\">Common Approach to Personal Names</h3><p>While
        a single input field for contributor names is common, separate fields for
        given and family names are required for <a href=\"http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#names\">proper
        formatting of citations</a>. As long as citations to scholarly content rely
        on properly formatted text rather than persistent identifiers, services holding
        bibliographic information have to support these separate fields. Further work
        is needed to help with the transition to separate input fields for given and
        famliy names, and to handle contributors that are organizations or groups
        of people.</p><h3 id=\"standardized-contributor-roles\">Standardized Contributor
        Roles</h3><p>The currently existing vocabularies for <strong>contributor type</strong>
        (DataCite) and <strong>contributor role</strong> (ORCID) provide a high-level
        description, but fall short when trying to describe the author/creator contribution
        in more detail. <a href=\"http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT\">Project CRediT</a>
        is a multi-stakeholder initiative that has developed a common vocabulary with
        14 different contributor roles, and this vocabulary can be used to provide
        this detail, e.g. who provided resources such as reagents or samples, who
        did the statistical analysis, or who contributed to the methodology of a study.</p><p>CRediT
        is complementary to existing contributor role vocabularies such as those by
        ORCID and DataCite. For contributor roles it is particularly important that
        the same vocabulary is used across stakeholders, so that the roles described
        in the data center can be forwarded first to DataCite, then to ORCID, and
        then also to other places such as institutional repositories.</p><h3 id=\"standardized-relation-types\">Standardized
        Relation Types</h3><p>Capturing relations between scholarly works such as
        datasets in a standardized way is important, as these relations are used for
        citations and thus the basis for many indicators of scholarly impact. Currently
        used vocabularies for relation types between scholarly works, e.g. by CrossRef
        and DataCite, only partly overlap. In addition we see differences in community
        practices, e.g. some scholars but not others reserve the term citation for
        links between two scholarly articles. The term data citation is sometimes
        used for all links from scholarly works to datasets, but other times reserved
        for formal citations appearing in reference lists.</p><h3 id=\"metadata-for-organisations\">Metadata
        for Organisations</h3><p>Both ORCID and DataCite not only provide persistent
        identifiers for people and data, but they also collect metadata around these
        persistent identifiers, in particular links to other identifiers. The use
        of persistent identifiers for organizations lags behind the use of persistent
        identifiers for research outputs and people, and more work is needed.</p><h3
        id=\"persistent-identifiers-for-projects\">Persistent Identifiers for Projects</h3><p>Research
        projects are collaborative activities among contributors that may change over
        time. Projects have a start and end date and are often funded by a grant.
        The existing persistent identifier (PID) infrastructure does support artefacts,
        contributors and organisations, but there is no first-class PID support for
        projects. This creates a major gap that becomes obvious when we try to describe
        the relationships between funders, contributors and research outputs.</p><p>Both
        the ORCID and DataCite metadata support funding information, but only as direct
        links to contributors or research outputs, respectively. This not only makes
        it difficult to exchange funding information between DataCite and ORCID, but
        also fails to adequately model the sometimes complex relationships, e.g. when
        multiple funders and grants were involved in supporting a research output.
        We therefore not only need persistent identifiers for projects, but also infrastructure
        for collecting and aggregating links to contributors and artefacts.</p><h3
        id=\"harmonization-of-orcid-and-datacite-metadata\">Harmonization of ORCID
        and DataCite Metadata</h3><p>We identified significant differences between
        the ORCID and DataCite metadata schema, and these differences hinder the flow
        of information between the two services. Several different approaches to overcome
        these differences are conceivable:</p><ol><li>only use a common subset, relying
        on linked persistent identifiers to get the full metadata</li><li>harmonize
        the ORCID and DataCite metadata schemata</li><li>common API exchange formats
        for metadata</li></ol><p>The first approach is the linked open data approach,
        and was designed specifically for scenarios like this. One limitation is that
        it requires persistent identifiers for all relevant attributes (e.g. for every
        creator/contributor in the DataCite metadata). One major objective for THOR
        is therefore to increase the use of persistent identifiers, both by THOR partners,
        and by the community at large.</p><p>A common metadata schema between ORCID
        and DataCite is neither feasible nor necessarily needed. In addition, we have
        to also consider interoperability with other metadata standards (e.g. CASRAI,
        OpenAIRE, COAR), and with other artifacts, such as those having CrossRef DOIs.
        What is more realistic is harmonization across a limited set essential metadata.</p><p>The
        third approach to improve interoperability uses a common API format that includes
        all the metadata that need to be exchanged, but doesn\u2019t require the metadata
        schema itself to change. This approach was <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-and-datacite-unify-support-for-http-content-negotiation/\">taken
        by DataCite and CrossRef a few years ago</a> to provide metadata for DOIs
        in a consistent way despite significant differences in the CrossRef and DataCite
        metadata schema. Using HTTP content negotiation, metadata are provided in
        a variety of formats.</p><h2 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h2><p>This
