        post</a> about the various things a journal article is doing,\nthe first being
        <em>a scientific report</em>. We put a lot of money in establishing a scientific
        track record. In the past 30 years\nhow we publish our research and how we
        archive it has changed significantly. If you read my blog more often, you
        know I have\nbeen critical of the performance of many publishers. Springer
        Nature was so disappointing that after 5 years I\n<a href=\"https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2021/06/11/conflict-of-interest-or-why-i-am.html\">stepped
        down</a>\nas Editor-in-Chief (of two) of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Cheminformatics\">Journal
        of Cheminformatics</a>.\nThere is so much that must be <a href=\"https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/2024/09/16/publishing.html\">done
        better</a>.</p>\n<p>But in the most recent iteration, triggered by some work
        for <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/\">WikiPathways</a>, I was using\n<a
        href=\"https://europepmc.org/\">Europe PMC</a> to find articles that\nmention
        <em>WikiPathways</em> and then search in the full text for the string <code
        class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WP</code>, as a trigger for
        the possible mention of\nWikiPathways pathway identifiers, which look like
        <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">WP4846</code>. The use
        of <em>compact (resource) identifiers</em>\n(see doi:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.29\">10.1038/sdata.2018.29</a>)
        is minimal, but at least some articles use identifiers.</p>\n<p>That allows
        me to extend our WikiPathways knowledge graph of <a href=\"https://www.wikipathways.org/browse/citedin\">articles
        citing specific pathways</a>.\nAt the time of writing, we collected 2509 citations
        from 440 different articles to 883 different pathways. Now,\nI want to blog
        about that more, but it\u2019s related to an observation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"information-loss\">Information
        loss</h2>\n<p>Now, back in the late ninities I learned about GNU/Linux and
        after playing with Red Hat and Suse, I settled for Debian.\nOne of the things
        I learned is that, generally, information corruption (like data loss) is an
        absolute red flag, a no-go,\na total showstopper.</p>\n<p>And then we have
        this in publishing, the one area where data corruption must also be a no-go:</p>\n<p><img
        alt=\"\" src=\"https://chem-bla-ics.linkedchemistry.info/assets/images/imageResolutionLoss.png\"/></p>\n<p>In
        this image, the left side shows a screenshot of the publisher version of the
        article and on the right side\nthe version in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\">Pubmed
        Central</a> (PMC). PMC has been an important project to archive full text
        versions of articles:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>11.2 million articles are archived
        in PMC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, this is <strong>really bad</strong>! The
        archived version is not really useful. As a human I already struggle to read
        the\ndegraded image, let alone an algorithm.</p>\n<p>Does that matter? Yes,
        projects like the awesome\n<a href=\"https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/\">Pathway
        Figure OCR</a> (see doi:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02181-2\">10.1186/s13059-020-02181-2</a>)\ndepend
        on images to be FAIR enough to extract information. (Side note: yes, these
        images should be vector\ngraphics, but commercial publishers decided about
        twenty years ago that they could not care enough.)</p>\n<p>At this moment,
        I do not know where the information is lost. Maybe PubMed Central is storing
        the images in a low\nresolution. Maybe the publisher provides PMC with a low
        resolution image. But to me, this must be solved as soon\nas possible. This
        is utterly unacceptable.</p>\n<p>I wonder what the authors of the article
        (doi:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-025-04166-z\">10.1186/s13287-025-04166-z</a>)\nI
