        Meeting of the Editorial Board</p>\n<p>The re3data.org editorial board was
        able to get together in person over the summer, meeting for two days in June
        at the library of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It was a great
        opportunity to on-board our new editors and to reconnect with colleagues to
        focus on updates and improvements to the registry. In addition to the work,
        the group enjoyed good food and fellowship in the evening.</p>\n<p>Some were
        not able to travel to Germany but were able to join remotely for introductions
        and an icebreaker to get to know each other better. The KIT staff led a tutorial
        and demonstrated the registry\u2019s backend editorial workflow, following
        a submission through each step in the process as it moved through the system.</p>\n<p>We
        also had a focussed discussion on new ways to engage with the broader research
        data community, first by sharing general strategies and then brainstorming
        specific approaches for each of our regions and networks. Each editor left
        with 2-3 action items of things they could do to raise awareness of re3data.org
        and to identify new repositories to index, in particular, from under-represented
        parts of the world. The board will revisit these on its next quarterly call
        to update each other on progress.</p>\n<p>Four additional working sessions
        addressed important topics. A hands-on activity explored inconsistencies over
        the years in how editors have identified different types of repositories,
        and they discussed potential changes to their approach to repository typology.
        The board mapped and investigated the alignment between Version 4 of re3data\u2019s
        <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48440/re3.014\">Metadata Schema for the Description
        of Research Data Repositories</a> and the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00103\">RDA
        Common Descriptive Attributes of Research Data Repositories recommendation</a>
        that was endorsed earlier this year by the Research Data Alliance. They explored
        how users from specific disciplines may experience the registry differently.
        For example, how would a humanities scholar interact with re3data.org in ways
        that would be different from a geoscientist? Each of the editors has individual
        expertise in different disciplines and presented their views in the context
        of their subject area. Last but not least, the group experimented and explored
        how artificial intelligence (AI) tools consume information about repositories
        that we present in the registry as well as how we may utilize AI to improve
        our work.</p>\n<p>The meeting concluded with a session of lightning talks
        on topics of relevance that were brought by our editors, which spanned a wide
        spectrum of initiatives and interests. </p>\n<p>This was the third in a series
        of three meetings that were sponsored by the <a href=\"https://www.dfg.de/\">Deutsche
        Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</a> in support of the <a href=\"https://coref.project.re3data.org/project\">COREF
        project</a>. The meetings helped reshape the editorial process, brought in
        missing language and subject expertise, and extended global networks to better
        cover regions that are currently underrepresented in re3data.</p>\n<p><img
