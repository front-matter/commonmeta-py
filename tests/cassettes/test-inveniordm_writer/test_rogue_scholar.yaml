        coincidence</a>, InvenioRDM is a very good fit for Rogue Scholar. Showing
        the metadata and content of Rogue Scholar blog posts can use more or less
        the default InvenioRDM record view, which you can see for example in <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/5479442\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Zenodo</a>. We show optional metadata for the journal title
        (i.e. the blog name) and ISSN. We display previews of the markdown and PDF
        version of the blog post, automatically generated by the Rogue Scholar API.
        The Rogue Scholar DOI is displayed as <em>identifier</em>, and clicking the
        DOI link brings you to the original blog post hosted on the blog participating
        in Rogue Scholar (here <a href=\"https://cameronneylon.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Science
        in the Open</a>).</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2024/10/Bildschirmfoto-2024-10-07-um-08.17.41.png\"

        1251w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>In contrast to Zenodo
        and most other InvenioRDM instances, Rogue Scholar DOIs point to content hosted
        elsewhere (by the participating science blog), as Rogue Scholar is an archive
        and not the primary place where content is hosted and metadata generated.
        Further work is needed to change what is displayed prominently, including
        the Rogue Scholar DOI, language, and subject areas (the latter two are also
        used as search filters/facets). In contrast, the resource-type and license
        status don''t need to be displayed prominently as they are the same \u2013
        resource-type <em>preprint</em> and license <em>open</em> (either CC-BY or
        CC0) \u2013 for all blog posts.</p><p>The only Rogue Scholar metadata that
        are not easy to show in InvenioRDM are <em>feature images</em> of blog posts,
        but this requires more work on the workflow for storing these images (not
        just the references) in Rogue Scholar, and then showing them as custom metadata.</p><p>Again
        in contrast to most other InvenioRDM instances, the record content and metadata
        are not generated by users filling out a web form, but are automatically generated
        from blog RSS feeds by the Rogue Scholar API. In the coming weeks, I will
        focus on integrating the Rogue Scholar API with the InvenioRDM API and bring
        all 100+ participating science blogs with more than 15,000 blog posts into
        the Rogue Scholar InvenioRDM instance.</p><h3 id=\"communities\">Communities</h3><p>One
        core functionality of InvenioRDM that enables exciting new features for Rogue
        Scholar is <em>communities</em>. Communities allow the grouping of blog posts
        into collections, and the most obvious use case is the grouping of blog posts
        by blog:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.front-matter.de/content/images/2024/10/Bildschirmfoto-2024-10-07-um-08.54.55-1.png\"

        1260w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>This enables functionality
        similar to what Rogue Scholar currently provides with <a href=\"https://rogue-scholar.org/blogs/ropensci\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">blog-specific views</a>. More work is needed to <a href=\"https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/customize/metadata/custom_fields/communities/\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">customize the blog community metadata</a> to include the
        RSS feed URL and blogging platform (both needed for automated content and
        metadata extraction).</p><p>These blog communities \u2013 like everything
        else in InvenioRDM \u2013 can be managed by the InvenioRDM API, and integration
        with the Rogue Scholar API is a top priority for October. </p><p>One important
        task for blogs participating in Rogue Scholar is integrating the DOIs registered
        by Rogue Scholar in the blog itself. For blogs publishing at low-frequency,
        this can be done manually, but for blogs publishing multiple times per month,
        this process should be automated. With the InvenioRDM API this can now be
        done with an API that is much more widely used and adopted, for the example
        above via the endpoint <a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/api/communities/ropensci/records\">https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/api/communities/ropensci/records</a>.</p><p>InvenioRDM
        records can be included in more than one community, and the obvious communities
        to use in addition to <em>blogs</em> are <em>topics</em>. The Rogue Scholar
        beta instance has started with 12 topic communities, which include these six
        <em>Open Science</em> communities:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/communities/openaccess\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Open Access</a></li><li><a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/communities/opendata\"

        rel=\"noreferrer\">Open Infrastructure</a></li></ul><p>In addition, there
        are six other topic communities covering topics that are popular with multiple
        Rogue Scholar blogs:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/communities/metascience\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Metascience</a></li><li><a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/communities/datascience\"

        rel=\"noreferrer\">Artificial Intelligence</a></li></ul><p>These topic communities
        have just started and only include a few blog posts each. Below is a screenshot
        of part of the <a href=\"https://beta.rogue-scholar.org/communities/openinfrastructure\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Open Infrastructure</a> community, where you can see that
        several Rogue Scholar blog posts talk about adopting the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.59350/b7mtv-gpn88\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure</a>, itself
        originally a blog post and included in Rogue Scholar (see also screenshot

        rel=\"noreferrer\">reach out</a> with comments, or if you want to help curate
        a new or existing community. As Rogue Scholar generates all metadata automatically
        from blog metadata, the question of changing blog post metadata by communities
        also needs more discussion.</p><p>As of today, 78 Rogue Scholar blog posts
        have been added to the Beta version of the InvenioRDM-based service. In the
        coming weeks, all currently 17,468 blog posts will be added via API, and added
        to appropriate topic communities. Until November 4, I will also work on interface
        glitches and bugs I encounter, and make sure the InvenioRDM Rogue Scholar
        instance scales appropriately with traffic. Please reach out <a href=\"mailto:info@rogue-scholar.org\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">via email</a> if you encounter bugs or performance issues.</p><p>The
        next InvenioRDM release (v12.1, planned for the next few weeks) will improve
        language support, and Rogue Scholar will benefit as it currently supports
        seven languages and 31% of blog posts are currently written in languages other
        than English (predominantly German and Spanish). Some work will be needed
        to translate the Rogue Scholar customizations.</p><h3 id=\"future-work\">Future
        Work</h3><p>After re-launching the Rogue Scholar frontend on November 4, the
        next phase of developing work will focus on consolidating duplicated resources,
        including two separate Postgres databases, Search indexes and APIs. Rogue
        Scholar currently uses <a href=\"https://typesense.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Typesense</a>
        for search versus <a href=\"https://opensearch.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenSearch</a>
        used by InvenioRDM. In contrast to the Rogue Scholar Typesense integration,
        InvenioRDM currently does not offer full-text search of content, so substantial
        development work is needed and will not be completed until 2025.</p><p>Both
        the Rogue Scholar and InvenioRDM API are written in Python and integrate with
        the similar <a href=\"https://quart.palletsprojects.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Quart</a>
        and <a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Flask</a>
        frameworks, respectively. Consolidating them is mostly about deciding what
        part of the Rogue Scholar functionality is of broader interest to the InvenioRDM
        community, e.g. automatic metadata extraction from RSS feeds or automatic
        generation of markdown, PDF, and other document formats using the <a href=\"https://pandoc.org\"
        rel=\"noreferrer\">Pandoc</a> document converter.</p><p>DOI registration of
        Rogue Scholar DOIs and metadata is done with Crossref. InvenioRDM supports
        DOIs registered externally, but for a deeper integration with fewer dependencies
        more work is needed. Full-text search, support for Crossref DOI registration,
        and RSS support are features of interest to other members of the InvenioRDM
        community, so this work will be coordinated.</p><h2 id=\"references\">References</h2><ol><li>Fenner,
