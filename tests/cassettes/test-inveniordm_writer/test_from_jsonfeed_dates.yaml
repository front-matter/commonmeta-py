        part A, I show maybe the simplest &#8212; or, at least, the one that is easiest
        to establish for most vertebrae. So long as you have a reasonably intact articular
        surface, just rotate the vertebra until that surface is vertical. If, as is
        often the case, the surface is not flat but concave or convex, then ensure
        the top and bottom of the surface are vertically aligned. This has the advantage
        of being easy to do &#8212; it&#8217;s what I did with <em>Xenoposeidon</em>
        &#8212; but it conceals complexities. Most obviously, what to do when the
        anterior and posterior articular surfaces are not parallel, in the 7th cervical

        from being parallel.</p></div>\n<p>Another difficulty with this interpretation
        of horizontality is that it can make the neural canal jagged. Consider a sequence
        of vertebrae oriented as in part A, all at the same height: the neural canal
        would rise upwards along the length of each vertebra, before plunging down
        again on transitioning from the front of one to the back of the next. This
        is not something we would expect to see in a living animal: see for example
        the straight line of the neural canal in <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2013/02/06/what-half-a-horse-head-looks-like/\">our
        hemisected horse head</a>(*).</p>\n<h2>Definition B: neural canal horizontal</h2>\n<p>Which
        leads us to the second part of the illustration above. This time, the vertebra
        is oriented so that the roof of the neural canal is horizontal, which gives
        us a straight neural canal. Nice and simple, except &#8230;</p>\n<p>Well,
        how do we define what&#8217;s horizontal for the neural canal? As the <em>Haplocanthosaurus</em>
        vertebra shows nicely, the canal is not always a nice, neat tube. In this
        vertebra, the floor is nowhere near straight, but dishes down deeply &#8212;
        which is why I used to the roof, rather than the floor of the canal. Rather
        arbitrary, I admit &#8212; especially as it&#8217;s often easier to locate
        the floor of the canal, as the dorsal margin is often confluent with fossae
        anteriorly, posteriorly or both.</p>\n<p>And as we can see, it makes a difference
        which we choose. The green line in Part B of the illustration above shows
        the closest thing to &#8220;horizontal&#8221; as it would be defined by the
        ventral margin of the neural canal &#8212; a straight line ignoring the depression
        and joining\u00a0the anteriormost and posteriormost parts of the base of the
        canal. As you can see, it&#8217;s at a significantly different angle from
        the red line &#8212; about 6.5\u02da out.</p>\n<p>And then you have human
        vertebrae, where the dorsal margin of the neural canal is so convex in lateral
        view that you really can&#8217;t say\u00a0<em>where</em> the anteriormost
        or posteriormost point is.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_15274\"

        can we do better? Can we find a definition of &#8220;horizontal&#8221; that&#8217;s
        not dependent of over-interpreting a single part of the vertebra?</p>\n<h2>Definition
        C: same points at same height in consecutive vertebrae</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve
        come to prefer a definition of horizontal that uses the whole vertebra &#8212;
        partly in the hope that it&#8217;s less vulnerable to yielding a distorted
        result when the vertebra is damaged. With this approach, shown in part C of
        the illustration above, we use two identical instances of the vertebrae, articulate
        them together as well as we can, then so orient them that the two vertebrae
        are level &#8212; that a line drawn between any point on one vertebra and
        its corresponding point on the other is horizontal. We can define that attitude
        of the vertebra as being horizontal.</p>\n<p>Note that, while we use two &#8220;copies&#8221;
        of the vertebra in this method, we are nevertheless determining the horizontality
        of a single vertebra in isolation: we don&#8217;t need a sequence of consecutive
        vertebrae to have been preserved, in fact it doesn&#8217;t help if we\u00a0<em>do</em>
        have them.</p>\n<p>One practical advantage of this definition is that its
        unambiguous as regards what part of the vertebra is used: all of it; or any
        point on it, at the measurement stage. By contrast, method A requires us to
        choose whether to use the anterior or posterior articular surface, and method
        B requires a choice of the roof or floor of the neural canal.</p>\n<h1>Discussion</h1>\n<p>I
        have three questions, and would welcome any thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Which
        of these definitions do you prefer, and why?</li>\n<li>Can you think of any
        other definitions that I missed?</li>\n<li>Does anyone know of any previous
        attempts to formalise this? Is it a solved problem, and Matt and I somehow
        missed it?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answers in the comments, please!</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Mannion,
