        This post is to explain what it&#8217;s about.</p>\n<p>Cancer cells often
        have <em>gene fusions</em>. This happens because the DNA in cancer cells is
        really messed up. Sometimes, chromosomes can break and get reattached to a
        different one in a strange way. This means you get a fusion between one gene
        and another which makes a new gene, called a gene fusion. There are famous
        fusions that are known to cause cancer, such as the <em>Philadelphia chromosome</em>
        in chronic myelogenous leukaemia. This rearrangement of chromosomes 9 and
        22 result in a fusion called BCR-ABL. There are lots of different gene fusions
        and a\u00a0few years ago, a new fusion was discovered in bladder and brain
        cancers, called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1220834\">FGFR3-TACC3</a>.</p>\n<p>Genes
        encode proteins and proteins do jobs in cells. So the question is: how are
        the proteins from gene fusions different to their normal versions, and how
        do they cause cancer? Many of the gene fusions that scientists have found
        result in a protein that continues to send a signal to the cell when it shouldn&#8217;t.
        It&#8217;s thought that this transforms the cell to divide uncontrollably.
        FGFR3-TACC3 is no different. FGFR3 can send signals and the TACC3 part probably
        makes it do this uncontrollably. But, what about the TACC3 part? Does that
        do anything, or is this all about FGFR3 going wrong?</p>\n<p><strong>What
        is TACC3?</strong></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1206\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1206\"

        or transforming acidic coiled-coil protein 3 to give it its full name, is
        a protein <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/bioa.1.3.16518\">important for
        cell division</a>. It helps to share the chromosomes to the two daughter cells
        when a cell divides. Chromosomes are shared out by a machine built inside
        the cell called the mitotic spindle. This is made up of tiny threads called
        microtubules. TACC3 stabilises these microtubules and adds strength to this
        machine.</p>\n<p>We wondered if cancer cells with FGFR3-TACC3 had problems
        in cell division. If they did, this might be because the TACC3 part of FGFR3-TACC3
        is changed.</p>\n<p>We weren&#8217;t the first people to have this idea. The
        scientists that found the gene fusion suggested that FGFR3-TACC3 might bind
        to the mitotic spindle but not be able to work properly. We decided to take
        a closer look&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>What did you find?</strong></p>\n<p>First
        of all FGFR3-TACC3 is not actually bound to the mitotic spindle. It is at
        the cells membrane and in small vesicles in the cell. So if it is not part
        of the mitotic spindle, how can it affect cell division? One unusual thing
        about TACC3 is that it is a dimer, meaning two TACC3s are stuck together.
        Stranger than that, these dimers can stick to more dimers and multimerise
        into a much bigger protein. When we looked at the normal TACC3 in the cell
        we noticed that the amount bound to the spindle had decreased. We wondered
        whether the FGFR3-TACC3 was hoovering the normal TACC3 off the spindle, preventing
        normal cell division.</p>\n<p>We made the cancer cells express a bit more
        normal TACC3 and this rescued the faulty division. We also got rid of the
        FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, and that also put things back to normal. Finally, we made
        a fake FGFR3-TACC3 which had a dummy part in place of FGFR3 and this was just
        as good at hoovering up normal TACC3 and causing cell division problems. So
        our idea seemed to be right!</p>\n<p><strong>What does this mean for cancer?</strong></p>\n<p>This
        project was to look at what is going on inside cancer cells and it is a long
        way from any cancer treatments. Drug companies can develop chemicals which
        stop cell signalling from fusions, these could work as anti-cancer agents.
        In the case of FGFR3-TACC3, what we are saying is: even if you stop the signalling
        there will still be cell division problems in the cancer cells. So an ideal
        treatment might be to block TACC3 interactions as well as stopping signalling.
        This is very difficult to do and is far in the future. Doing work like this
        is important to understand all the possible ways to tackle a specific cancer
        and to find any problems with potential treatments.</p>\n<p><strong>The people</strong></p>\n<p>Sourav
        Sarkar did virtually all the work for this paper and he is first author. Sourav
        left the lab before we managed to submit this paper and so the revision experiments
        requested by the peer reviewers were done by Ellis Ryan.</p>\n<p><strong>Why
        didn&#8217;t we post this paper as a preprint?</strong></p>\n<p>My group have
        generally been posting our new manuscripts as preprints while they undergo
        peer review, but we didn&#8217;t post this one. I was reluctant because many
        cancer journals at the time of submission did not allow preprints. This has
        changed a bit in the last few months, but back in February several key cancer
        journals did not accept papers that had appeared first as preprints.</p>\n<p>&#8212;</p>\n<p>The
