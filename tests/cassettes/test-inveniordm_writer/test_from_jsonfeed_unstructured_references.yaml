        become apparent because of amateur sleuthing through PubPeer.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m
        going to wane philosophical for a minute. In general I&#8217;m very sympathetic
        to Adam Mastroianni&#8217;s line &#8220;don&#8217;t worry about the flood
        of crap that will result if we let everyone publish, publishing is already
        a flood of crap, but <a href=\"https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem\">science
        is a strong-link problem</a> so the good stuff rises to the top&#8221;. I
        certainly don&#8217;t think we need <em>stronger</em> pre-publication review
        or any more barrier guardians (although I have <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2021/02/04/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-the-shiny-digital-future/\">reluctantly
        concluded that having some is useful</a>). But when fraudulent stuff like
        this does in fact rise to the top in what seems to be a strong-link network
        &#8212; lots of NIH-funded labs, papers in top journals (or, apparently, &#8220;top&#8221;
        journals) &#8212; then I despair a bit. Science has gotten so specialized
        that almost anyone could invent facts or data within their subfield that might
        pass muster even with close colleagues (even if those colleagues aren&#8217;t
        on the take, he said cynically &#8212; there is a mind-boggling amount of
        money floating around in the drug-development world).</p>\n<p>Immediate thought
        experiment: could Mike or I come up with material for a blog post or paper
        that would be false but good enough to fool the other? Given how often we
        find surprising or even <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2023/03/28/new-paper-out-today-aureliano-et-al-2023-on-pneumaticity-in-the-early-dinosaur-macrocollum/\">counterintuitive
        results</a>, I think possibly so. I&#8217;m not particularly motivated to
        run the experiment when we&#8217;re already digging out from a deep backlog
        of started-but-never-finished papers, but it remains a morbidly fascinating
        possibility.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_22908\"

        one problem is that &#8220;top&#8221; journals have a lot of fraudulent or
        at least incorrect science in them, roughly corresponding to their impact
        factors. Now, you might say &#8220;yeah but the positive correlation means
        bad actors get caught&#8221;, to which I&#8217;d reply &#8220;not fast enough&#8221;
        and &#8220;how do you know we&#8217;re catching all of them?&#8221;</p>\n<h1>Sinking
        feeling</h1>\n<p>There&#8217;s another problem, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s
        equal-and-opposite but it definitely exists: good science that doesn&#8217;t
        float to the top. Here are a couple of quick examples from my neck of the
        woods:</p>\n<p>Working from very little evidence by modern standards, Longman
        (1933) had correctly figured out that pneumatic sauropod vertebrae come in
        two flavors, those with a few large chambers and those with many small chambers.
        He called them &#8220;phanerocamerate&#8221; and &#8220;cryptocamerillan&#8221;,
        corresponding to the independently-derived modern terms &#8220;camerate&#8221;
        for the open-chambered form and &#8220;camellate&#8221; or &#8220;somphospondylous&#8221;
        for the honeycombed one. As far as I have been able to determine, nobody paid
        any attention to this before Wedel (2003b) &#8212; Longman&#8217;s work on
        vertebral internal structure wasn&#8217;t mentioned or cited by Janensch in
        the 1940s or Britt or anyone else in the 1990s. To be clear, I&#8217;m not
        putting myself forward as a better researcher than anyone that came before.
        I just got lucky, to have read a fairly obscure paper while I had my antennae
        out for any possible mention of pneumaticity.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Janensch,
        his 1947 paper on pneumaticity in dinosaurs was pretty much ignored until
        the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_19963\"

        vertebra of anything other than <em>Sauroposeidon</em> that Kent Sanders and
        I scanned.</p></div></p>\n<h1>I owe my career to the Dinosaur Renaissance</h1>\n<p>Here&#8217;s
        what bothers me about this: I made my career studying pneumaticity in sauropods,
        buoyed in large part by the fact that I stumbled backwards into a situation
        where I had access to a big collection of sauropod bones (at the OMNH), free
        time on a CT scanner (at the university hospital), and a curious and collaborative
        radiologist (Kent Sanders). But you don&#8217;t need a CT scanner to study
        pneumaticity, as John Fronimos has convincingly demonstrated (see Fronimos
        2023 and <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2024/03/29/four-paths-to-studying-pneumaticity-inexpensively-and-why-you-should/\">this
        post</a>). So why didn&#8217;t the revolution in sauropod pneumaticity happen
        in 1933 or 1947? Or, heck, in 1880 &#8212; Seeley and Cope and Marsh and many
        others recognized that sauropods had highly chambered vertebrae.</p>\n<p>I
        think the most likely explanation is that at the time no-one cared. Pneumatic
        vertebrae in sauropods were possibly interesting trivia, but sauropods were
        an evolutionary dead end and so their vertebrae couldn&#8217;t tell us anything
        important about evolutionary success. These attitudes may not have been universal,
        but they were certainly prevailing.</p>\n<p>I had the good fortune to come
        along at a time when there was renewed interest in dinosaur paleobiology,
        particularly any characters or body systems shared between non-avian dinosaurs
        and birds. Suddenly pneumaticity wasn&#8217;t some obscure bit of trivia,
        but the skeletal footprint of a bird-like respiratory system that was potentially
        a key adaptation for sauropods (Sander et al. 2011) and possibly for dinosaurs
        more generally (Schachner et al. 2009, 2011). And dinosaurs weren&#8217;t
        any more of an evolutionary dead end than we are, they just happened to mostly
        not fit into small holes or deep water when the asteroid hit.\u00a0 (Let&#8217;s
        heat the atmosphere to 400F for a few hours and then make the world dark for
        a few months or years and then we can talk about evolutionary dead ends.)
        So adaptations that facilitated dinosaurosity might tell us something about
        evolutionary success after all.</p>\n<h1>What are you doing in that cell?</h1>\n<p>Having
        a successful career because I happened to hitch a ride on a wave of renewed
        interest in dinosaur paleobiology is certainly nice, but also worrisome. If
        it takes 70 or 100 years for the good science to float to the top, does that
        really count? Whatever convection cells push the good science toward the top
        would ideally work more like a cook pot on a rapid boil, and not like the
        imperceptible roiling of Earth&#8217;s mantle. So ask yourself: what&#8217;s
        still on its way up to the top right now, that no-one has clocked yet? What&#8217;s
        the Longman (1933) of 2024 &#8212; the seemingly incidental observation that
        is going to seem prophetic in a few decades? Or worse, what was the Longman
        (1933) of 1994 or 2004, the solid paper that attracted no attention and won&#8217;t
        for another half century?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://svpow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kay-et-al-2021-figure-4-pt-prevalence-across-primates.jpg\"><img

        cell metaphor is particularly apt because a lot of science is siloed. A good
        idea &#8212; say, that the peroneus tertius muscle occurs at a lower frequency
        in monkeys and apes than in humans, and this tells us something about its
        evolution &#8212; may rise to the top in one cell (comparative anatomy), but
        not make it over to the neighboring cell (clinical anatomy), where all the
        happy little molecules think that peroneus tertius is a muscle unique to humans
        (if you have no idea what I&#8217;m on about, see the second numbered point
        in <a href=\"https://svpow.com/2024/09/07/were-not-going-to-run-out-of-new-anatomy-anytime-soon/\">this
        post</a>).</p>\n<p>So if you want to do good work &#8212; in this metaphor,
        to be at the top where the good science floats (eventually, alongside a seasoning
        of not-yet-unmasked bad science) &#8212; then I think you have to be aware
        that other cells exist, and occasionally peer into them, if for no other reason
        than to make sure you don&#8217;t accept an idea that&#8217;s already been
        debunked over there. And you need to read broadly and deeply in your own cell
        &#8212; there&#8217;s almost certainly valuable stuff you don&#8217;t know
        because the relevant works are stuck to the bottom of the pot. Go knock &#8217;em
        loose.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/iai.05661-11\">Fang,
