        ongoing outbreaks of mpox globally. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
        is so far the worst hit with a total of 7,851 cases and 384 deaths reported
        between January 1 and May 26, 2024 <sup>1</sup>. Before 2022, there were few
        reports of sustained mpox transmission globally. However, during the following
        year (Jan 1, 2022, and Jan 29, 2023), 110 countries in all six WHO Regions
        had reported a total of 85,473 confirmed cases and 89 deaths between them

        and direct contact with infected persons. The disease is characterized by
        fever, cough, and a rash, with the mean incubation period estimated to be
        about 7.8 days <span class=\"citation\" data-cites=\"ward2022transmission\">(Ward
        et al. 2022)</span>. Infected individuals may experience severe symptoms leading
        to hospitalisation or death. There are two genetic clades: clade I and clade
        II, which also has subclades IIa and IIb <span class=\"citation\" data-cites=\"laurenson2023description\">(Laurenson-Schafer
        et al. 2023)</span>.</p>\n<p>Several analyses of the potential impact of outbreaks
        at country level have already emerged in 2024. The US CDC, for example, has
        analysed the potential size of outbreaks resulting from transmission within
        and between households <sup>2</sup> and the risk of Clade 1 mpox outbreaks
        among some key populations associated with key transmission routes <sup>3</sup>.
        Another group of researchers have estimated the transmissibility of mpox in
        the DRC from more recent (2010 - 2019) surveillance data to update existing
        estimates, which are based on old data <span class=\"citation\" data-cites=\"charniga2024updating\">(Charniga,
        McCollum, et al. 2024)</span>. However, tackling ongoing outbreaks around
        the world will require a coordinated response from the global health community.</p>\n<p>The
        Epiverse-TRACE team is developing a set of analytical tools that could help
        support decision-makers during outbreaks. This post provides an overview of
        the tasks that such tools can be applied to in the context of the ongoing
        mpox outbreaks.</p>\n<section class=\"level2\" id=\"common-outbreak-analytics-tasks\">\n<h2

        potential, forecasting infection dynamics, estimating severity, and assessing

        key initial question during emerging outbreaks is the transmission potential
        of the disease. This is typically quantified using parameters such as: the
        basic reproduction number, <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_0\"/>;
        the time-varying reproduction number, <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t\"/>;

        is the average number of secondary cases produced by a single infected individual

        susceptible population. <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t\"/>
        is a more useful quantity during an outbreak as it accounts for the impact
        of interventions and changes in population immunity.</p>\n<p>If data is available
        on the daily number of reported cases, <a href=\"https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/\"><code>{EpiNow2}</code></a>
        and <a href=\"https://mrc-ide.github.io/EpiEstim/\"><code>{EpiEstim}</code></a>
        can be used to estimate <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t\"/>.
        These packages require data on the time scale of transmission (i.e.\u00a0the
        generation time, or the serial interval, which is <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2020.0756\">commonly
        used as a proxy</a> for this). While <code>{EpiEstim}</code> focuses on retrospective
        estimation of <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t\"/>, <code>{EpiNow2}</code>
        is designed for both retrospective and real-time estimation.</p>\n<p>In estimating
        <img src=\"https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R_t\"/>, one practical consideration
        is the impact of various delays (biological and reporting) on the estimates

        gostic2020practical\">(Charniga, Park, et al. 2024; Park et al. 2024; Katelyn
        M. Gostic 2020)</span>. <code>{EpiNow2}</code> adjusts for these delays in
        various ways. For example, it accounts for the symptom onset and reporting
        delays by taking the incubation period and reporting delay as inputs. Moreover,
        <code>{EpiNow2}</code> can estimate the reporting delay from the data if data
        on incidence by date of onset and report are available.</p>\n<p>Furthermore,
        dedicated packages have emerged for estimating epidemiological delays from
        data using best practices. <a href=\"https://epidist.epinowcast.org/articles/epidist.html\"><code>{epidist}</code></a>
        offers the ability to estimate delay distributions, accounting for issues
        such as truncation (i.e., not all disease outcomes will yet be known in real-time).</p>\n<p>If
        delay data are not available, published estimates of the incubation period
        and serial interval can be used. The <a href=\"https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/\"><code>{epiparameter}</code></a>
        package collates a database of epidemiological distributions from the literature
        and provides functions for interacting with the database. You can view the
        <a href=\"https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/dev/articles/database\">database</a>
        for currently available parameters (more entries are planned). Additionally,
        if only summary statistics are available (e.g.\u00a0range and median), <code>{epiparameter}</code>
        can be used to extract the distribution parameters.</p>\n</section>\n<section
