        are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID integration tool:</p>\n<ul><li>it
        makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their research outputs.</li><li>it
        shows the value of persistent identifiers for data, publications and people,
        and linking them together</li><li>it shows the Creative Commons licenses for
        DataCite content where this info is available, facilitating reuse of content</li><li>it
        demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open collaboration,
        standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment
        (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace) tools</li><li>it shows that we don\u2019t
        need a single \u2013 often closed \u2013 system, but open services that build
        on top of each other using accepted community standards. Tools using the ORCID
        API can immediately reuse the new DataCite content, altmetrics provided by
        <a href=\"https://impactstory.org/\">ImpactStory</a> are a good example</li></ul>\n<p>I
        want to explore some of these ideas in the panel <strong>Attribution: Managing
        Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics</strong> at the combined <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013\">ORCID/Dryad
