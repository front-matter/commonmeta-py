        few things recently have made me think about how we support the core work
        of maintaining research software and supporting its users.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol
        class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I was interviewed by Georgia Iacovou for her
        report, &#8220;<a href=\"https://geoiac.notion.site/Funding-Open-Source-Science-Software-b11741a8c9a24a91b8a367629092f674\">The
        state of the open source ecosystem &amp; how to fund away \u2018software collapse\u2019</a>&#8220;.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I&#8217;ve
        been chairing some of the meetings of the <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/\">Research
        Software Alliance (ReSA)</a> <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/funders-forum/\">Funders
        Forum</a>, and co-organized part of a side meeting on research software at
        the <a href=\"https://grc2024interlaken.ch/\">Global Research Council&#8217;s
        2024 meeting</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I attended the <a href=\"https://confmeet.github.io/ccs2024/\">2024
        NSF CSSI/Cyber Training/SCIPE PI Meeting</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We&#8217;re
        getting towards the end of awards to Parsl for sustainability and maintenance
        from NSF (<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209919\">award1</a>,
        <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2209920\">award2</a>)
        and CZI (<a href=\"https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/sustaining-parsl-enabling-extreme-scale-biomedicine/\">award3</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I&#8217;ve
        spent significant time planning and now working on the <a href=\"https://corsa.center/\">CORSA</a>
        project.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I&#8217;ve been chatting with Mike Woster from the
        Linux Foundation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In these discussions and this work
        on Parsl, it&#8217;s become clear to me that there are parts of a medium-size
        open-source research software project like <a href=\"https://parsl-project.org/\">Parsl</a>
        that can be sustained by a community. This includes adding new features and
        some user support, which we can do through a combination of community contributions
        and collaborations, funding from projects that use Parsl, and funding for
        our own research that requires us to maintain Parsl.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,
        as the project grows both in code and users and as it ages, ongoing core work
        is needed, which we cannot always provide without some funding or voluntary
        effort specifically for this purpose. This core work includes user support,
        which grows with the number of users, though some of this can be done, and
        for us, is now being done by advanced users. While some maintenance work also
        will always be needed to avoid <a href=\"https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MCSE.2019.2900945\">software
        collapse</a>, how its magnitude changes over time is less clear, as our goal
        has been to pay down the technical debt that came with our initial &#8220;experimental&#8221;
        code, and arguably, we are succeeding in doing this. The core work also includes
        our community manager, who has provided tremendous value to helping Parsl
        grow; however, this is a function that is very hard to convince existing users
        to pay for.&nbsp; In both cases, volunteer effort alone isn&#8217;t really
        sufficient: we don&#8217;t just need someone to do these things, but we need
        someone specific with the right experience in the project to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My
        thinking on this is probably specific to projects that are similar to Parsl
        in size (of code and community) and in research orientation. I think there
        are valid models to support the core work for other types of projects, such
        as both smaller (e.g., a single researcher) and larger (e.g., 5+ core developers)
        research projects as well as many open-source projects that are not research
        focused, some of which have a large user community and a solid business and
        financial model. But it&#8217;s not clear to me that we understand how to
        support the core work for a project with a community and developers similar
        in size to Parsl&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About the time I finished working
        at NSF, leading activities to fund sustainable research software, I was optimistic
        and created <a href=\"https://github.com/danielskatz/sustaining-research-projects\">a
        set of models</a> that I thought would be sufficient, based in very large
        part on <a href=\"https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand\">work done around
        how developers in open source could fund their work</a>.&nbsp; Today, I think
        that projects in Parsl&#8217;s position are going to remain dependent on grants,
        at least for this core maintenance and community work. For Parsl in particular,
        I think we really need about 0.5 FTE/year for core maintenance, and about
        0.5 FTE/year for our community work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the longer term, I could
        imagine a few additional options. One would be institutional support from
        universities and other research institutions. In the case of Parsl, this would
        be the University of Chicago and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
        and perhaps other institutions that want to get involved and take more of
        an ownership and governance stake in the project, by supporting the project
        via internal (not grant) funds and treating the project as a part of the institution&#8217;s
        assets rather than just a research project that happens to have some contributors
        at the institution. This would be similar to how some non-research open-source
        projects work, with multiple companies contributing time from their employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another
        option would be more indirect funding from funders (government, philanthropic,
        industry) who want to support the open-source research software ecosystem,
        because doing so will support their overall goals. This might be similar to
        what DOE is trying with the <a href=\"https://cass.community/\">Consortium
        for the Advancement of Scientific Software (CASS)</a> (where I&#8217;m a co-PI
        in one of the member organizations, <a href=\"https://corsa.center/\">CORSA</a>).
        My interpretation of DOE&#8217;s future vision for this is that they provide
        funding to sustain key software to CASS, which uses a decision-making process
        that hasn&#8217;t yet been fully determined to in turn provide funds to maintain
        the software that DOE research depends on, where DOE provides funding for
        the ecosystem without directly deciding which projects it funds, leaving this
        decision to be made by a set of software and user stakeholders. It seems that
        this model could be expanded to include multiple global funders and their
        goals, since most research software is developed, maintained, and used globally,
        and typically is useful for more than one research project and research goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I
        should mention here that this discussion is fairly specific to projects like
        Parsl (open-source research software, medium community size, most users are
        publicly-funded research projects). There are many other situations where
        other models might work, such as <a href=\"https://www.globus.org/\">Globus</a>
        with its model of closed source software provided as a service and supported
        by institutions, or <a href=\"https://charmplusplus.org/\">Charm++</a>, which
        was free for non-commercial use, and has just <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/laxmikant-sanjay-kale-964ab14_we-are-happy-to-announce-the-release-of-activity-7227375565291347968-e7Yj\">recently
        switched</a> to an OSI-compliant license. There&#8217;s also software like
        <a href=\"https://ambermd.org/\">Amber</a>, which continues to be free for
        non-commercial use, but has a license fee for commercial use. These projects
        all have used fees to support the core software work. Outside research software,
        more general open source models, such as the <a href=\"https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/\">Free
        and Open Source Software (FOSS) Sustainability Fund</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors\">GitHub
        Sponsors</a>, seem promising, but I can&#8217;t see them helping research
        software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some sense, none of this thinking is new,
        and it all goes back to the fact that while open-source research software
        is typically seen as free because it is free to obtain, it is not free to
        develop or maintain. As ReSA has expanded its work and impact, I think more
        government and philanthropic funding agencies have started to recognize this
        and create programs to address it, but these programs aren&#8217;t coordinated,
        and they aren&#8217;t sufficient to support all of the software that research
        needs. And industry overall hasn&#8217;t been brought into this discussion
        about research software, though a small number of companies have proven willing
        to support some of the software they use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To wrap up this discussion
        for now, I think the open-source ecosystem has some types of projects that
        can be successfully supported, while others currently don&#8217;t fit well
        into these existing models, due at least in part to the size of the developer
        and user communities, and the fact that they are primarily research software.
        As discussed above, there are potentially two paths forward that I see:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol
        class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Institutions start to see open-source software
        as reputational and operational important and invest in it. For institutions
        that have a strong, well-resourced research software organization (e.g., an
        RSE organization, a research computing center) this seems possible, although
        given the current forces to reduce institutional spending, it seems relatively
        unlikely to happen, at least in universities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The model of
        CASS might provide hope for the future, particularly if it could be expanded
        to more funders. I hope funders and the community will continue to talk about
        this, in part via the <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/\">ReSA Funders
        Forum</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, it&#8217;s clear to me that
        part of the job of Parsl and similar projects is to raise awareness about
        this, and to share lessons and successes. For Parsl, our successes do include
        that the community growth has led to members who are willing to get more involved
        in parts of the software project, and infrastructure providers (e.g., NERSC)
        who make sure Parsl works with their resources and their users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>:
