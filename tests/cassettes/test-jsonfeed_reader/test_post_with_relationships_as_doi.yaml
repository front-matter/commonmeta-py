        identifiers (PIDs) are not only important to uniquely identify a publication,
        dataset, or person, but the metadata for these persistent identifiers can
        provide unambiguous linking between persistent identifiers of the same type,
        e.g. journal articles citing other journal articles, or of different types,
        e.g. linking a researcher and the datasets they produced.</p>\n<p>Work is
        needed to connect existing persistent identifiers to each other in standardized
        ways, e.g. to the outputs associated with a particular researcher, repository,
        institution or funder, for discovery and impact assessment. Some of the more
        complex but still important use cases can\u2019t be addressed by simply collecting
        and aggregating links between two persistent identifiers, including</p>\n<ol><li>Aggregate
        the citations for all versions of a dataset or software source code</li><li>Aggregate
        the citations for all datasets hosted in a particular repository, funded by
        a particular funder, or created by a particular researcher</li><li>Aggregate
        all citations for a <a href=\"http://www.researchobject.org/\">research object</a>:
        a publication, the data underlying the findings in the paper, and the software,
        samples, and reagents used to create those datasets.</li></ol>\n<p>To address
        these use cases we need a more complex model to describe the resources that
        are identified by PIDs, and the connections between them: a graph. In graph
        theory, the resources identified by PIDs correspond to the nodes in this graph,
        and the connections between PIDs correspond to the edges.</p>\n<p>Using a
        graph makes it easier to describe these more complex use cases and relationships,
        and this approach has been frequently applied to similar questions in the
        past. FREYA builds on the expertise and close collaboration with the <a href=\"http://researchgraph.org/\">Research
        Graph</a> team and adopts the outputs of the <a href=\"https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-description-registry-interoperability.html\">Research
        Data Alliance DDRI Working group</a> to transform PID connections into an
        improved graph of research objects. This project takes advantage of the best
        practices of graph modelling and distributed network analysis techniques.
        We call this the <strong>PID Graph</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pid-graph-use-cases\">PID
        Graph Use Cases</h3>\n<p>Before starting work on implementing the PID Graph,
        the FREYA partners collected user stories from their communities relevant
        to the PID Graph work. We used GitHub issues in a public repository for this
        activity and then met in person in August 2018 to clarify, group and prioritize
        these user stories. In total, we identified 48 user stories, described <a
        href=\"https://github.com/datacite/freya/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PID+Graph%22++label%3A%22user+story%22+\">here</a>.
        The main outcomes of the August 2018 workshop were:</p>\n<ol><li>There is
        a significant number of relevant user stories that can only be addressed by
        implementing a PID Graph.</li><li>While there is a diverse number of stakeholder
        groups and persistent identifier types in these user stories, a number of
        common themes and major use cases emerged in the workshop.</li><li>We didn\u2019t
        identify any uses cases that require more than two connections between PIDs,
        simplifying the required implementation work needed.</li></ol>\n<p>After identifying
        and describing the most relevant use cases, summarized above, we started the
        implementation work for the FREYA PID Graph. Our goal was to implement the
        PID Graph as standard production service rather than a research activity or
        pilot service, so scalability and maintainability are of utmost importance.
        We learned a lot from the extensive experience gained in the <a href=\"http://researchgraph.org/\">Research
        Graph</a> initiative and decided to build PID Graph using a set of federated
        RESTful JSON APIs. PID Graph will not be a single service but federated between
        FREYA PID providers, FREYA disciplinary partners, and organizations outside
        of FREYA. PID Graph will be provided by <a href=\"https://restfulapi.net/\">RESTful
        JSON APIs</a> that describe the resources (nodes) and connections (edges)
        in this graph. All FREYA PID providers use RESTful JSON APIs to provide PID
        metadata so that this approach aligns with the extensive existing infrastructure.</p>\n<h3
        id=\"initial-pid-graph-implementation\">Initial PID Graph Implementation</h3>\n<p>The
        first working PID Graph implementation is provided by DataCite, extending
        the existing Event Data Service (Dasler &amp; Cousijn, <a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/s6d3-k860\">2018</a>),
        a collaboration between Crossref and DataCite. Event Data is a service that
        provides connections (here called events) between PIDs and other resources,
        with an initial focus on social media mentions and data citations. The initial
        PID Graph work done by DataCite since the August 2018 workshop has added these
        functionalities to <a href=\"https://datacite.org/eventdata.html\">DataCite
        Event Data</a>:</p>\n<h4 id=\"include-metadata-about-resources\">Include metadata
        about resources</h4>\n<p>Include not only metadata about connections but also
        metadata about the resources identified by PIDs. This dramatically simplifies
        the API calls needed to construct a PID Graph. We do this by optionally including
        the metadata for the <strong>subj</strong> and <strong>obj</strong> (the resources
        linked via the event) in Event Data via an extra query parameter: <a href=\"https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj\">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj</a></p>\n<p>Including
        the metadata for subj and obj also enables queries based on resource metadata,
        e.g. query by type of content that is connected: <a href=\"https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;citationType=ScholarlyArticle-SoftwareSourceCode\">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;citationType=ScholarlyArticle-SoftwareSourceCode</a></p>\n<p>This
        query today returns 1,078 events connecting scholarly articles and software,
        including 834 from journal articles referencing software via Crossref metadata
        and 210 from software referencing journal articles via DataCite metadata.</p>\n<h4
        id=\"include-implicit-relations-in-metadata-about-resources\">Include implicit
        relations in metadata about resources</h4>\n<p>Metadata for resources contain
        a lot of information about connected PIDs. We can take advantage of this by
        including the information in DataCite Event Data, allowing queries that in
        effect connect two PIDs via an intermediary resource and two connections.
        Specifically, we include these relations and associated PIDs:</p>\n<ol><li>Version,
        e.g. dataset A <strong>isVersionOf</strong> dataset B (using DataCite <strong>relatedIdentifier</strong>
        metadata)</li><li>Granularity, e.g. dataset A <strong>isPartOf</strong> dataset
        B or dataset A <strong>isSupplementTo</strong> article B (using DataCite <strong>relatedIdentifier</strong>
        metadata)</li><li>Funding, e.g. dataset A <strong>isFundedBy</strong> funder
        B (using DataCite <strong>fundingReferences</strong> metadata)</li><li>Author,
        e.g. dataset A <strong>isAuthoredBy </strong>author B (using DataCite <strong>nameIdentifier</strong>
        metadata)</li></ol>\n<p>These connected PIDs can then act as a <strong>proxy</strong>
        in PID Graph queries, as demonstrated in this example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.5061/dryad.k5k9074\">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.5061/dryad.k5k9074</a></p>\n<p>The
        query today returns one data citation of the dataset identified by the DOI,
        and eight data files that are part of this dataset. If someone decides to
        cite one of these data files instead of the dataset (following principle 8
        Specificity and Verifiability of the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles
        (Data Citation Synthesis Group, <a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk\">2014</a>)),
        that data citation would also be included in the DataCite Event Data response.</p>\n<p>Similarly,
        the citation of a specific version of a dataset would be included if querying
        for the parent version of the dataset. Examples for funding and authorship
        are given in the next paragraph.</p>\n<h4 id=\"include-more-types-of-events\">Include
        more types of events</h4>\n<p>The initial focus in Event Data was on social
        media mentions and data citations. DataCite has added author-resource links
        and funder-resource links, using ORCID and Crossref Funder ID as PIDs, respectively.
        DataCite also include dataset usage statistics, as part of the work in the
        Make Data Count (Lowenberg, Budden, &amp; Cruse, <a href=\"https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/pre3-2f25\">2018</a>)
        project. This enables the following two use cases:</p>\n<ol><li>Show all datasets
        created by a particular researcher and their usage stats <a href=\"https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;orcid=0000-0002-1194-1055\">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;orcid=0000-0002-1194-1055</a>.
        The query today returns four datasets created by a researcher identified via
        her ORCID ID, plus a combined 21 unique views of these datasets in February
        and March 2019.</li><li>Show all datasets funded by the European Commission
        that have been cited by a journal article <a href=\"https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.13039/501100000780&amp;citation-type=Dataset-ScholarlyArticle\">https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&amp;doi=10.13039/501100000780&amp;citation-type=Dataset-ScholarlyArticle</a>.
        The query today returns 69 datasets cited by 37 journal articles.</li></ol>\n<h3
        id=\"collaborating-on-research-data-graph-initiatives\">Collaborating on Research
        Data Graph Initiatives</h3>\n<p>The aim is for any interested parties within
        and beyond FREYA to implement PID Graph services, meaning that we have to
        figure out how best to coordinate and enable this federated PID Graph. And
        of course, there are initiatives outside of FREYA taking similar approaches
        and addressing similar use cases. These include:</p>\n<ol><li>The already
        mentioned Research Graph Foundation</li><li><a href=\"http://www.scholix.org/\">Scholix</a>:
        a framework for Scholarly Link Exchange coordinated by a Research Data Alliance

        a broker service initially developed to track software citations in astronomy.</li></ol>\n<p>To
        coordinate these activities we have organized a Birds of a Feather session
        at the RDA Plenary in Philadelphia next week (Wednesday at 2:30 PM): <a href=\"https://rd-alliance.org/bof-Research-Data-Graph-RDA-13th-Plenary-meeting\">Research
        Data Graph</a>.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation of the PID Graph in DataCite
        Event Data contains 5.38 million events as of today and more work is needed
        to convert existing events to the new format (we expect a total of 25 million
        events with the current data source), improve documentation, and build visualizations
        and other frontend services to make it easier to show the PID Graph information
        we already have. But if you can\u2019t wait and are not afraid working with
        JSON REST APIs, feel free to explore DataCite Event Data, which is a free
        service with no registration required, by starting with the <a href=\"https://support.datacite.org/docs/eventdata-guide\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>And
        please reach out to us via the <a href=\"https://www.pidforum.org/\">PID Forum</a>
        if you are interested to learn more about PID Graph, want to see your data
        in PID Graph, or are working on a related project and want to coordinate.
