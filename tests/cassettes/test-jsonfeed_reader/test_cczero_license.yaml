        this yet another commitment to trying to write here a little more regularly.
        Lots of thinking has been going on but not much writing! At least not writing
        as I&#8217;m going&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three things colliding over the
        past few weeks have led me to want to try and get some ideas down. The first
        was a conversation \u2013 one of a set really \u2013 with Titus Brown and
        Dan Katz relating to the application of political economy and collective action
        theory to communities building research. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second was
        the posting of video of a talk I gave a month or so back to our research centre,
        the Centre for Culture and Technology at Curtin University. In this, I tried
        to work through the full story of some recent thinking for the first time.
        I&#8217;m trying to articulate what has evolved in my thinking from a view
        driven by network theory that open is good, more open is better, to an understanding
        of where and how things have gone wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final piece was
        the publication of a new paper (<a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/14352/\">preprint
        version is also available</a>, actually its what I read so that&#8217;s what
        I&#8217;ll link to) by Sabina Leonelli which tackles the value of reproducibility
        as a concept head on. Leonelli&#8217;s work has been a big influence on my
        developing thinking. Two pieces are particularly relevant. The <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=i8NADQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=sabina+leonelli&amp;ots=iBvrf8uB3L&amp;sig=I5cdiwlIRoZQrm7iX2ksRe70ias&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=sabina%20leonelli&amp;f=false\">idea
        that data is not a thing, but is a category defined by use</a>. That is, we
        can&#8217;t say whether a particular object <em>is</em> data, only that something
        is data when it is used in particular ways. This is true of many things in
        research, the objectivist in us wants the qualities of objects like data,
        methods, and knowledge itself to be eternal platonic concepts inherent in
        the objects themselves. In practice however these qualities only reveal themselves
        in certain activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These activities depend in turn on &#8216;repertoires&#8217;
        another concept I&#8217;ve taken from Leonelli&#8217;s work, this time from
        <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2016.08.003\">a paper published
        with Rachel Ankeny</a>. The concept here is that research communities are
        defined by practices and that these practices are not just learned, but displayed
        and internalised, in a similar manner to a musician learning repertoire as
        a set of hurdles to be jumped in their development. I first read this paper
        at the same time as I was reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Situated-Learning-Participation-Computational-Perspectives/dp/0521413087/\">Lave
        and Wenger&#8217;s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Situated-Learning-Participation-Computational-Perspectives/dp/0521413087/\">Situated
        Learning</a></em> and the parallel between craft learning (see also <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scientific-Knowledge-Its-Social-Problems/dp/1560008512\">Ravetz</a>),
        identity making (see also <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/cultural-science-9781849666022/\">Hartley
        and Potts</a>) and community had a significant resonance for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        the new piece Leonelli tackles the range of different, and largely incommensurate
        meanings that are ascribed to the concept of &#8216;reproducibility&#8217;.
        The paper tackles a range of disciplinarily bound practices ranging from computational
        sciences, where there is &#8216;total control&#8217; (yes I could quibble
        about machine states and compilers but this is philosophy, let&#8217;s accept
        the abstraction) through to ethnography, where there is the expectation that
        the life experience of the researcher affects the outcome, and that a different
        researcher would reach different conclusions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article focuses
        on how the necessity for documentation changes as different aspects of <em>accountability</em>
        rather than reproducibility are taken into account. These concepts of responsibility
        and accountability for sources of variability that have implications for the
        claims being made seems more productive and more readily contextualised and
        generalised. The article finishes with a call to value &#8216;epistemic diversity&#8217;.
        That is, it is through differing kinds of cross referencing, with different
        sources of variability, accountability, and reliability that we can most usefully
        build knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this resonates for me because I&#8217;ve
        been working towards a similar end from a different place. My concern has
        been thinking about how to operationalise social models of knowledge production.
        There are a broad class of constructivist models of knowledge where validation
        occurs when groups come together and contest claims. I have a paper currently
        in review that casts this as &#8216;productive conflict&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In
        such models the greater the diversity of groups in contact the more &#8216;general&#8217;
        the knowledge that is created. However the more diverse those groups are,
        the less likely it is that such contact will be productive. Indeed it can
        be harmful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in most cases involving disadvantaged groups
        (which is practically everyone in comparison to a professional, permanently
        employed, western academic) it is at the very least a significant burden and
        frequently significantly damaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed

        trying to work through the question of how such contacts can be made safe,
        while equally privileging the value of closing ranks, returning to community
        to regain strength and re-affirm identity. If diversity is a first order principle
        in the utilitarian goal of making knowledge, what are the principles of care
        that allow us to protect the communities that contribute that diversity? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part
        of the argument I make is that we need to return to the thinking about network
        structures. Five years ago I was making the case that &#8216;bigger is better&#8217;
        underpinned by an assumption that even if benefits flowed to those who were
        already well connected the new opportunities of scale would still spread benefits
        more widely. That seems less and less to be the case today, and the key problems
        appear to be ones where the benefits of locality are reduced or broken, boundaries
        are too readily traversed, and groups come into contact in <em>non-productive</em>
        conflict too frequently.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/BibYCjjYUQdN13?startSlide=94\"

        max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen> </iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>In the talk I discuss
        the need to privilege locality. This is the opposite of what most of our systems
        do today, both in the wider world (&#8216;you need to go viral!&#8217;) and
        in academia (&#8216;international rankings! international journals!&#8217;).
        Many social models draw simple lines with groups inside or outside. Even with
        a mental view of groups within groups and overlapping groups this tends to
        miss the messiness that results from non-homogenous interactions across group
        boundaries. Network structural analysis is harder to do and harder to visualise
        but it seems to me crucial to get a view of what the optimal dynamics are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One
        way to frame the question of network and community dynamics is economically.
        That is, to ask how the differing groups and communities in contact are sustained
        and succeed or fail. This in turn is a question of exchange (not necessarily
        purely financial exchange, but there are limitations to this framing!). Models
        of club economics and collective action from political economy are useful
        here and this leads us back to the first conversation I mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titus
        Brown has been working through <a href=\"http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/tag/cpr.html\">a
        series of posts</a>, relating to the NIH Data Commons project looking at the
        goods produced in open source projects through the lens of commons and clubs
        goods. Dan Katz was raising good questions about issues of time and scale
        that are not well captured by the classical analysis of goods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure

        have quibbles with Brown&#8217;s analyses and often with others who use this
        kind of goods-class analysis. However I only just realised that my issue was
        similar to Leonelli&#8217;s point about data. The question of what is &#8216;the
        good&#8217; in any particular case is relational, not an absolute. Our discussion
        of these models tends to turn on an implicit assumption that something (prestige,
        code, knowledge, expert attention) is the specific good in play, something
        that in turn surfaces a common assumption in most classical economics that
        it is appropriate to assume some kind of &#8216;numeraire good&#8217; that
        allows exchange of all the others (this is what money is for, and if there&#8217;s
        anything wrong with economic analysis, its money..). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t
        leave me with any firm conclusions beyond some possible routes to analysis.
        It seems likely that simple analysis based on static descriptions of community
        and the environment aren&#8217;t going to give us answers. We need to understand
        dynamics of groups opening up and enclosing over time, what sustains them,
        and what they might find valuable in exchange. We need agent based modelling
        of the network structures these occur over, and ways of translating from local
        structure in networks to more &#8216;bright-lined&#8217; social models of
        groups. We need to move beyond the simple &#8216;economic mathematics&#8217;
        that is often developed from the the club economics of Buchannan and Olson
        and to develop much more sophisticated and flexible models that allow the
        nature of exchange and goods to change when viewed from different perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All
        in all it emphasises the conclusion I&#8217;d reached, that diversity is a
        first order principle. All forms of diversity and the more diverse the better,
        provided the coordination between groups is principled. There&#8217;s a lot
        to unpack in that word &#8216;principled&#8217; but I feel like its the link
        to the ethical dimension I&#8217;ve been missing. I need to dig deeper into
        notions of &#8216;care&#8217; (Moore, Priego) and &#8216;flourishing&#8217;
        (Holbrook) to tease this out. <br></p>\n","doi":"https://doi.org/10.59350/xgwqt-1sq35","funding_references":null,"guid":"http://cameronneylon.net/?p=20035","id":"fcaadcf6-5511-4f6e-b346-090faf10c5c9","image":null,"indexed_at":1741174148,"language":"en","parent_doi":null,"published_at":1540284134,"reference":[],"registered_at":0,"relationships":[],"rid":"8x3ev-zgm51","subfield":null,"summary":"<em>\n
