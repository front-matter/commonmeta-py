        returned to the Town and Country resort San Diego for its\n31st installment
        this January (Jan 12-17, 2024), bigger and better than\never before! The GigaScience
        Press team are regular attendees of the\nmeeting (see <a\nhref=\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/plant-and-animal-genomes/\">last\nyears
        write-up</a>), and this year members of our Editorial and Curation\nteams
        joined nearly 3000 delegates from over 60 countries.</p>\n<p>With a leisurely
        start to the conference on the Friday around 10am,\nmy first stop was to reacquaint
        myself with the fine work of the Oxford\nNanopore Technology (ONT) team at
        their ORG.one session. <a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karadicks/\">Kara

        (of plant\nand animal genomes) of threatened or endangered species. They will\nprovide

        already\nsequenced through this project including the; Butternut (an endangered\nspecies
        of Walnut in USA); the Widemouth gambusia (a sulphide adapted\nspecies of
        fish in Mexico); the Eastern Hoolock gibbon of China; as well\nas what may
        well have been the most entertaining presentation by final\nyear PhD student
        <a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-hains-b2638715a/\">Taylor\nHains</a>
        on 6 genomes of endangered Macaws and Cockatoos from across\nthe world (especially
        as <em>GigaScience</em> has a <a\nhref=\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/big-science-goes-local-democratization-of-sequencing-demonstrated-by-the-parrot-genome/\">soft\nspot</a>
        for parrot genomes). Taylor presented with great passion for\nthe subject
        showing in equal measure both excitement and despair!\nApparently, avian genomes
        differ from mammalian genomes in that they\ncommonly contain many many micro-chromosomes
        (or to use Taylors wording\n\u201cParrots have messed up chromosomes!\u201d)
        that are almost impossible to\nidentify by karyotyping. This difference can
        cause issues (often\nresulting in tears) with the informatics tools which
        are generally\ndesigned for use with mammal genomes.</p>\n<p>Whether the micro-chromosomes
        are the reason or not has yet to be\ndetermined, but a feature of parrots
        is that they are able to mate\nacross species boundaries, and regularly do
        (again in Taylors inimitable\nstyle \u201c<em>Biology doesn\u2019t apply to
        parrots they are just horny little\nbastards!</em>\u201d. This is a feature
        that results in a multitude of\ndifferent hybrids which tend to be very popular
        with the pet trade as\nthey can be highly unusual and beautiful specimens.</p>\n<h2
        id=\"data-reuse\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data\nreuse</span></h2>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data reuse was a recurrent theme in\nmany of the
        sessions. <em>GigaScience</em> Editorial Board Member (EBM)\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mschatz/\">Mike\nSchatz</a>\u2019spresentation
        included a mention of the GTEx project, which\nis now 10 years old, and is
        essentially a reanalysis of 311TB of raw\ndata hosted in DBGap, which has
        been accessed by &gt;250 groups around\nthe world. Some simple maths shows
        that if all 250 groups had downloaded\nthe raw data to re-do the analysis
        themselves it would have meant\n&gt;100PB of data had been stored in multiple
        duplicates. This is simply\nnot a scaleable solution, hence the need to run
        the analysis in the data\nstorage environment rather than copy large data
        files to a place to run\nthe analysis. AnVIL is one such tool that enables
        multiple groups to\nwork on 1 copy of data in the cloud.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AgBioData consortium have a Data\nreuse working
        group, which presented on the importance of data quality,\nincomplete metadata,
        and lack of incentives for researchers to provide\nit. They advocate for a
        common standard across all genomes to be adopted\nto enable easier sharing
        and comparison. They also highlighted a paper\npublished in 2021 (sorry I
        missed the reference) that showed &gt;50% of\ncases where the author had indicated
        that data is available on request\nbut had failed to provide those data when
        requested.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"plenaries\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plenaries</span></h2>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the fact the conference\nstarted on Friday
        morning, we had to wait until Sunday evening for the\nfirst plenary speaker,
        <a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/appolinaire-djikeng-01930b12/\">Appolinaire\nDjikeng</a>,
        who preceded the opening reception in the exhibition hall.\nAmong many accolades
        mentioned in his introduction, Appolinaire was a\nrecipient of the Nelson
        Mandela Justice award in 2020 for his work in\nglobal agricultural development.
        The topic of his presentation at PAG\nwas \u201cLivestock and the Food Systems:
        A Focus on Smallholder Systems in\nthe Global South\u201d. Appolinaire outlined
        various challenges that we still\nface in the global food system particularly
        related to food security, as\nwell as highlighting the recent advances that
        are helping meet those\nchallenges. A key feature of the talk was the different
        approaches to\nfarming in different countries, particularly the tendency for
        the Global\nNorth to create large fields with little or no crop diversity
        compared\nto the smallholder style farming predominant in the Global South.
        And we\nshould be aware that the right solution to these challenges may be\ndifferent
        in those different settings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over
        the following 3 days we received\n6 more plenary talks from distinguished
        scientists from around the\nworld. <a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-van-dorp-7b40a823b/\">Lucy
        Van\nDorp</a> presented virtually on the subject of tracking pathogens in\nspace
        and time, using the recent COVID-19 pandemic as an example of\ndata-rich reconstruction
        of the evolution of the virus genome through\ntime.\u00a0</span></p>\n<div

        id=\"machine-learning\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine\nLearning</span></h2>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In line with the current trends in\nall areas
        of science, there were a good deal of talks using or\ndiscussing the potential
        of machine learning technologies. For example,\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismungall/\">Chris
        Mungall</a>\nspoke about \u201cUsing Large Language Models to Build Ontologies\u201d.
        Due to a\ndelayed flight, Chris actually arrived at the meeting room during
        the\nquestion time of the speaker preceding him, (some may say perfect\ntiming)
        but that didn\u2019t fluster him in the slightest. With hundreds of\nontologies
        in use in plant and animal genomics it\u2019s a challenge to keep\nthem up-to-date,
        so can LLMS (large language models) help with that? In\nshort, Chris seems
        to think there is a great potential for it to, yes,\nparticularly if Retrivall
        Augmented Generation (RAG) tools can be used\nto get more accurate results
        e.g.\u00a0 DRAGON AI. Experiments were performed\nto check how well the DRAGON
        AI-generated term definitions compared to\nthe human-written ones by blind
        review and ranking. The result was that\nthe human-generated definitions were
        on average more understandable and\naccurate than the AI-generated ones. However,
        there is scope to use AI\nto fill the gaps with some human oversight and checks.
        Chris stressed\nthat these tools will not replace humans but could lead to
        greater\nproductivity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In
        a similar vein, <a\nhref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksey-zimin-b331121b7/\">Aleksey\nZimin</a>
        presented \u201cData Beats Machine Learning for Genome Annotation\u201d.\nZimin\u2019s
        group examined the use of machine learning techniques to\nannotate genomes
        and found that they do provide an increased coverage,\nbut generally at a
        cost to accuracy particularly in the UTRs. He\nproposes a tool called \u201ceviAnn\u201d
        which uses protein evidence from related\nspecies to annotate genomes.</span></p>\n<h2
        id=\"citizen-science\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citizen\nScience</span></h2>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As followers of GigaScience Press\nwill know,
        we are great <a\nhref=\"http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/tag/citizen-science/\">advocates\nof
        citizen science projects</a>, so I was delighted to attend the\n\u201cParticipatory
        and Citizen Science Genomics\u201d session. For me the\nhighlight of the session
        was \u201cThe INCREASE Citizen Science Project\n(</span><a href=\"http://www.pulsesincrease.eu\"><span\nstyle=\"font-weight:

        Kerstin Neumann presented an overview of\nthe project which in summary aims
        to revive (genetic) diversity from\ngene banks back into the community for
        the common bean. It is now\nentering its 4th year with a steady increase in
        participation from\nacross Europe. It\u2019s a mixture of social science (community
        building) and\nphenomics. Citizen participants are each provided with a selection
        of 5\ndifferent heritage seed lines from a seed bank along with 1 control
        line\n(the same line is given to every participant) and asked to grow them
        at\nhome and record various traits in an app. The community participants are\nencouraged
        to discuss challenges with one another via a Facebook group\nwhich reduces
        the administrative burden of dealing with direct queries.\nThe community aims
        to foster seed sharing from person to person. Each\nparticipant is expected
        to save some seed from each harvest to regrow\nand/or share with others, while
        any excess produce is for their personal\nconsumption. The app includes 36
        traits split by the level of experience\nof the users from beginners to experts,
        as this is a Europe-wide\nproject, it\u2019s also translated into various
        European languages to enable\ncommunication with participants.\u00a0 At present
        this project is only\navailable within Europe due to the issues with import/export
        of living\nmaterials.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-end\"><span style=\"font-weight:
        400;\">The end</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many
        of us, the science ended\nrather abruptly when the fire alarm at the conference
        centre went off\nduring the penultimate talk of the last session just before
        lunch.\nSpeaking to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenbrabham/\">Helen\nBrabham</a>
        after her talk (which was one of those interrupted by the\nfire alarm) it
        appears most participants (including myself I must admit!\nSorry Helen) opted
        to get lunch on the lawn after the fire alarm instead\nof heading back into
        the session. Despite this slightly disappointing\nend to the working day,
        it was not all over yet! As tradition states,\nthe final night of PAG is the
        conference banquet, where the exhibition\nhall is turned into a giant banqueting
