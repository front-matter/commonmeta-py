        residents within the healthcare profession, our first duty is to care for
        our patients. While working upwards of 80 hours per week pursuing that mission,
        it is hard to think of ourselves as anything beyond our job title. But we
        are also citizens. And while patient care remains a worthy North Star, decisions
        made by faraway policymakers can impact our patients as much as the assessments
        and plans we ourselves craft. In some cases, they can impact our training
        as well. Fortunately, as citizens, we can choose our policymakers so long
        as we exercise our right to vote. In this perspective, we present the results
        of an institutional quality improvement study of surgery resident voting and
        propose program initiatives to facilitate resident participation in this core
        duty of citizenship.</p><p>Voting is the most direct manner by which citizens
        can participate in a democracy. A recent study found that physicians historically
        voted at lower rates than the general population but matched and exceeded
        national turnout in 2018 and 2020, respectively. The increase in physician
        participation was hypothesized to stem from the greater prominence of health-related
        issues in the public discourse. Barriers to voting included not being registered,
        being too busy, or having a conflicting work schedule.<sup>1</sup> Currently,
        voting participation among General Surgery residents - for whom these barriers
        are especially magnified - is unknown.</p><p>Following the 2022 United States
        (U.S.) midterm election, we surveyed categorical General Surgery residents
        at our institution. We asked respondents to identify their post graduate year
        (PGY) level and state of registration. We then asked if they voted in the
        2022 U.S. midterm election. Respondents who did not vote were asked to select
        one or more reasons for not voting, including scheduling conflicts, registration
        issues, difficulty obtaining mail-in ballots, unfamiliarity with candidates
        or issues, apathy about the outcome, or not wanting to vote.</p><p>Overall,
        32/46 (70%) residents responded to the survey, and 28/32 (88%) were eligible
        to vote in U.S. elections. Among those eligible to vote, 13 (46%) voted in
        the 2022 U.S. midterm election. Turnout rate was 3/7 (43%) among PGY1s, 1/4
        (25%) among PGY2s, 3/5 (60%) among PGY3s, 1/4 (25%) among PGY4s, 0/3 (0%)
        among PGY5s, and 5/5 (100%) among research residents. Fourteen (50%) residents
        were registered in New York, the state of our institution, while five (18%)
        were registered in New Jersey, two (7%) in Pennsylvania, and one each (4%)
        in Alabama, California, Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. Two residents (7%) were
        unsure about their current registration status.</p><p>Among the 15 eligible
        residents who did not vote, nine (60%) said they wanted to vote but were too
        busy. Seven (47%) said there was no way to leave work long enough to vote,
        seven (47%) expressed issues with mail-in ballots or associated deadlines,
        three (20%) did not know about candidates or issues in their area, and two
        (13%) had issues with registration or associated deadlines. One (7%) said
        they didn''t care about the outcome of the election or hold strong political
        beliefs. No residents said they did not want to vote (Figure 1).</p><figure

        width=\"1920\"/></figure><p>Our study is too small in size and limited in
        geography to predict surgery resident turnout in a generalizable manner. However,
        our results reveal patterns that may be relevant to residents across the United
        States. We found that the overall voter turnout rate among surgical residents
        at our institution (46%) matched the national voter turnout rate in the 2022
        U.S. midterm election. However, this rate was significantly buoyed by unanimous
        participation amongst research residents, possibly because research residents
        have greater schedule flexibility and more bandwidth to engage with the electoral
        process. It is also possible that respondents were more likely to vote than
        non-respondents, and thus the true voter turnout rate may be lower. For reference,
        a similar study by Lalani and colleagues<sup>2</sup> found that residents
        from multiple specialties at a single institution in Texas voted at a rate
        of 69% in the prior (2018) midterm election, exceeding the national turnout
        rate of 51%. Of note, a majority (87%) of respondents were from non-surgical
        specialties. They similarly found that lack of time was the most common barrier
        to voting, though in contrast to our data, they reported a higher percentage
        of residents (23%) facing psychological barriers such as the belief their
        vote wouldn''t count.<sup>2</sup></p><p>There may be several reasons that
        eligible individuals do not vote or even register. In addition to the process
        being difficult, potential voters may not like any of the candidates or feel
        that their vote will make a difference.<sup>3</sup> Nevertheless, many of
        the logistical barriers to voting that residents in our sample reported can
        be addressed by program-wide efforts. First, programs can highlight important
        dates such as registration and mail-in ballot deadlines during department-wide
        conferences. Second, program leaders can facilitate voter registration for
        residents, by making the necessary paperwork easily available and providing
        the administrative support to submit it on time. This would be especially
        helpful for interns who are moving to a new state for the first time. Third,
        residents can devise a system to cover pager duties to allow each other time
        to vote in person, addressing the time constraints cited in our study. However,
        this itself may be largely unnecessary. With mail-in voting supported in most
        states, residents may not need to leave the hospital during election day at
        all. This would be particularly relevant for residents who vote in a different
        state than the one in which their program is located. In select states, programs
        can collect mail-in ballots from residents and drop them off all at once -
        removing one more additional burden from residents'' schedules.<sup>4</sup>
        Ideally, ballot drop-off boxes could be placed within the hospital itself,
        significantly facilitating voting access for residents, other providers, and
        patients alike.</p><p>Some may question whether citizenship is essential to
        surgical training, or merely a distraction from the core mission. To the contrary,
        the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) lists \"systems-based
        practice\" as a core competency.<sup>5</sup> Whether in improving the conditions
        of our patients or our training environment, it is important to recognize
        that the \"system\" extends beyond the four walls of the hospital. Thus, training
        programs have a responsibility to make us not just excellent surgeons, but
        also effective citizens. Yes, residents may have an obligation to vote because
        issues that affect our patients and our work are on the ballot. But there
        may be issues entirely outside of healthcare that are meaningful to residents
        also. Exercising the right to vote fulfills a basic human need for self-determination.
        A powerful reminder that residents are whole human beings who can participate
        in our democracy may help preserve their agency and multi-dimensionality.</p><p>In
        the future, we hope to partner with national surgical societies to study resident
        voting across programs and geographies. Using this data, we can identify barriers
        to voting and build state-specific guidelines to minimize the friction in
        the voting process for residents. As future leaders of surgical care in the
        United States, residents should have the ability to perform this core civic
        duty. Our data suggest that residents would vote if the process was not prohibitively
        difficult or time consuming. We can make it so.</p><h3 id=\"references\">\u00a0References</h3><p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0
