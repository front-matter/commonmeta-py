        with a blog post later this week explaining the DataCite auto-update implementation.</em></p>\n<p>Since
        ORCID\u2019s inception, our key goal has been to unambiguously identify researchers
        and provide tools to automate the connection between researchers and their
        creative works. We are taking a big step towards achieving this goal today,
        with the launch of <a href=\"http://orcid.org/blog/2014/11/21/new-functionality-friday-auto-update-your-orcid-record\">Auto-Update</a>
        functionality in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/\">Crossref</a>
        and <a href=\"https://www.datacite.org/\">DataCite</a>.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s
        already been a lot of excitement about Auto-Update: <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-to-auto-update-orcid-records/\">Crossref\u2019s
        recent announcement</a> about the imminent launch generated a flurry of discussion
        and celebration on social media. Our own <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/647020600192581633\">tweet</a>
        on the topic was viewed over 10,500 times and retweeted by 60 other accounts.</p>\n<p>So
        why all the fuss? We think Auto-Update will transform the way researchers
        manage their scholarly record. Until now, researchers have had to manually
        maintain their record, connecting new activities as they are made public.
        In ORCID, that meant using <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems\">Search
        &amp; Link</a> tools developed by our member organizations to claim works
        manually. Researchers frequently ask, \u201cWhy, if I include my ORCID iD
        when I submit a manuscript or dataset, isn\u2019t my ORCID record \u201cautomagically\u201d
        updated when the work is published?\u201d</p>\n<p>With the launch of Auto-Update,
        that is just what will happen.</p>\n<p><strong>It might seem like magic but
        there are a few steps to make it work</strong>:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Researchers</strong>.
        You need to do two things: (1) use your ORCID iD when submitting a paper or
        dataset, and (2) authorize Crossref and DataCite to update your ORCID record.
        In keeping with our commitment to ensuring that researchers maintain full
        control of their ORCID record, you may revoke this permission at any time,
        and may also choose privacy settings for the information posted on your record.</li><li><strong>Publishers
        and data centers</strong>. These organizations also have two things to do:
        (1) collect ORCID identifiers during the submission workflow, using a process
        that involves authentication (not a type-in field!), and (2) embed the iD
        in the published paper and include the iD when submitting information to Crossref
        or DataCite.</li><li><strong>Crossref and DataCite</strong>. Upon receipt
        of data from a publisher or data center with a valid identifier, Crossref
        or DataCite can automatically push that information to the researcher\u2019s
        ORCID record. More information about how to opt out of this service can be
        found here: <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953\">the
        ORCID Inbox</a>.</li></ul>\n<h3 id=\"why-is-this-so-revolutionary\">Why is
        this so revolutionary?</h3>\n<p>A bit of background, first. Crossref and DataCite,
        both non-profit organizations, are leaders in minting DOIs (Digital Object
        Identifiers) for research publications and datasets. A <a href=\"http://www.crossref.org/01company/16fastfacts.html#sthash.o7NGwOnP.dpuf\">DOI</a>
        is a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object \u2013 in this
        case, an electronic journal article, book chapter, or a dataset. Each DOI
        is associated with a set of basic metadata and a URL pointer to the full text,
        so that it uniquely identifies the content item and provides a persistent
        link to its location on the internet.</p>\n<p>Crossref, working with over
        a thousand scholarly publishers, has generated well over 75 million DOIs for
        journal articles and book chapters. DataCite works with nearly 600 data centers
        worldwide and has generated over 6.5 million DOIs to date. Between them, Crossref
        and DataCite have already received almost half a million works from publishers
        and data centers that include an ORCID iD validated by the author/contributor.
        With Auto-Update functionality in place, information about these articles
        can transit (with the author\u2019s permission) to the author\u2019s ORCID
        record.</p>\n<p>Auto-Update doesn\u2019t stop at a researcher\u2019s ORCID
        record. Systems that have integrated ORCID APIs and have a researcher\u2019s
        ORCID record connected to that system -- their faculty profile system, library
        repository, webpage, funder reporting system -- can receive alerts from ORCID.
        Information can move easily and unambiguously across systems.</p>\n<p>This
        is the beginning of the end for the endless rekeying of information that plagues
        researchers -- and anyone involved in research reporting. Surely something
        to celebrate!</p>\n<p><strong>Questions you may have</strong>:</p>\n<h4 id=\"q-what-do-i-need-to-do-to-sign-up-for-auto-update\">Q.
        What do I need to do to sign up for auto-update?</h4>\n<p>You need to grant
        permission to Crossref and DataCite to post information to your ORCID record.
        You can do this today by using the Search and Link wizard for DataCite available
        through the ORCID Registry or the <a href=\"https://search.datacite.org/\">DataCite
        Search</a> page. We also have added a new ORCID Inbox, so that you can receive
        a message from Crossref or DataCite if they receive a datafile with your iD,
        and you can grant permission directly. See <a href=\"https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953\">more
        on the ORCID Inbox</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"q-will-crossref-and-datacite-be-able-to-update-my-orcid-record-with-already-published-works-for-which-i-did-not-use-my-orcid-id\">Q.
        Will Crossref and DataCite be able to update my ORCID record with already
        published works for which I did not use my ORCID iD?</h4>\n<p>No. The auto-update
        process only applies to those works that these organizations receive that
        include your ORCID iD. For previous works that did not include your ORCID
        iD, you will need to use the DataCite and Crossref Search and Link wizards
        to connect information with your iD.</p>\n<h4 id=\"q-what-information-will-be-posted-to-my-record\">Q.
        What information will be posted to my record?</h4>\n<p>With your permission,
        basic information about the article (such as title, list of contributors,
        journal, or publisher) or dataset (such as data center name and date of publication)
        will be posted, along with a DOI that allows users to navigate to the source
        paper or dataset landing page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"q-what-if-my-journal-or-data-center-doesn%E2%80%99t-collect-orcid-ids\">Q.
        What if my journal or data center doesn\u2019t collect ORCID iDs?</h4>\n<p>Ask
        them too! This simple step can be accomplished using either the Public or
        Member ORCID APIs. Information about integrating ORCID iDs in <a href=\"http://members.orcid.org/publisher-workflow\">publishing</a>
        and <a href=\"http://members.orcid.org/repository-systems\">repository</a>
        workflows is publicly available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</h3>\n<p>This
