        moved the main Crossref systems to the cloud! We''ve more to do, with several
        bugs identified and fixed, and a few still ongoing. However, it''s a step
        in the right direction and a significant milestone, as, whilst it is a much
        larger financial investment, it addresses several risks and limitations and
        shores up the Crossref infrastructure for the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-background\">Some
        background</h3>\n<p>We have been doing a lot of thinking, planning, and working
        on paying down our technical debt and modernising our systems. It''s not fun
        and flashy work, but it is vital for sustaining our infrastructure, meeting
        the demand on existing services, and developing new services.</p>\n<p>Just
        about a year ago, we completed phase one, migrating our main database from
        Oracle to PostgreSQL, an open-source database. This move brought us more in
        line with our commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi/\">POSI
        principles</a>, reduced our dependencies on costly private licenses, and opened
        up the possibility to use and offer additional and more contemporary features.
        With the transition to PostgreSQL we made upgrades to the operating system,
        the database software, and the underlying hardware, resulting in significant
        improvements to the overall throughput and capacity of the deposit system.
        Previously, we typically maintained a queue of more than 10,000 deposits waiting
        to be processed; now, the queue holds fewer than 100 deposits on average.
        Consequently, the average latency \u2013 the elapsed time from submission
        to deposit \u2013 has reduced from hours to seconds.</p>\n<p>During phase
        one, a total of 35 new servers were created, and for the first time, the entire
        system configuration was defined through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code\"
        target=\"_blank\">infrastructure-as-code</a>, enabling the infrastructure
        to be recreated as necessary. This effort not only enabled the migration but
        also established a solid foundation for our cloud migration strategy, as the
        code was leveraged to configure our infrastructure on AWS. Additionally, it
        serves as a critical component of our disaster recovery planning.</p>\n<p>Most
        importantly, phase one set us up for phase two and our next migration: moving
        the system into the cloud.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-we-moved-to-the-cloud\">Why we
        moved to the cloud</h3>\n<p>We had been running most of our services in a
        physical data centre near Boston, MA, USA (there are a few exceptions: the
        <a href=\"https://www.crossref.org/blog/weve-migrated-to-the-cloud-we-hope-you-didnt-notice-but-maybe-you-did//api.crossref.org\">REST
        API</a> and our test system (test.crossref.org) were already in the cloud,
        as was the Crossref website). We''ve been planning to move to the cloud for
        <em>ahem</em> quite some time, but as always, competing priorities and limited
        resources have thwarted us, and the data centre was mainly serving us well.</p>\n<p>But\u2026
        with staff across 12 countries, and increased global use of our system, operating
        our own hardware in a physical data centre was becoming increasingly challenging
        and risky, not to mention, frustrating.</p>\n<p>Moving to the cloud has solved
        several pain points for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical access to the data centre
        was required for various tasks (e.g., hardware upgrades, troubleshooting,
        general maintenance), but as Crossref grew as an organisation and became more
        distributed, we had fewer staff in the area. Hosting services in the cloud
        means staff around the world can access our servers remotely from anywhere
        (and we can leave the hardware upgrades to our vendor).</li>\n<li>Scalability
        in the data centre required installing new hardware or upgrading connections,
        which also meant a good amount of time. In the cloud, we can scale up almost
        instantly.</li>\n<li>We can maintain copies of our databases and services
        in distributed places, providing insurance against natural or other disasters.\nUpgrades
        now don''t involve buying physical hardware and installing it; it''s a much
        quicker and more straightforward process.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Moving from a physical
        data centre to the cloud also has some trade-offs; for instance, the cost
        will be approximately five times higher than running the system in the data
        centre; with initial data, it''s not unlikely the annual cost may be up to
        2,000,000 USD. We aim to optimise and control this cost going forward.</p>\n<h3
        id=\"what-we-did\">What we did</h3>\n<p>The size of the undertaking was partly
        due to leaving it so long; technical debt has accumulated over many years
        of running the system in the data centre.</p>\n<p>The whole plan was hugely
        detailed, but we can distil it to a few bullets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We conducted
        an analysis of components, considered risks and sequencing, and created a
        test plan and timeline, including comms.</li>\n<li>While most of the drive
        and work was on the shoulders of two infrastructure services colleagues, our
        software engineers were heavily involved too, and we had weekly check-ins
        with a cross-team group to review progress, reassess risks, and adjust timelines
        as we got closer to the migration date (or decided to move it once or twice).</li>\n<li>We
        first created the deposit system in the cloud.</li>\n<li>We then created other
        parts of our services that aren''t in the deposit system code base, but run
        alongside it, such as reports, querying, and other tools.\nWe replicated our
        databases (of which there are several, in a few different flavours - PostgreSQL,
        MySQL).</li>\n<li>We gave 14 days'' notice to our members, via email, and
        kept this maintenance notice up to date.</li>\n<li>We commenced the migration
        on 8th July, which involved taking the whole system down and rejecting deposits
        for up to 24 hours.</li>\n<li>In the process, we scripted the process to create
        CS and the other services using Terraform and Ansible, so that going forward,
        bringing up a whole new instance of CS (should we need to) won''t be a manual
        process.</li>\n<li>We moved the DNS to point at our new system in the cloud,
        rather than the data centre. We brought the system back up on 9th July, after
        14 hours of downtime, and watched the first few deposits come in, while testing
        thoroughly.</li>\n<li>Alongside the technical team, the membership and support
        team was at the ready to work through the testing in the new live production
        environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The message we sent to members, Metadata Plus
        subscribers, and key integrators like PKP and Turnitin, listed which services
        would be down and described what changes they might see, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The
        system timezone shifted from EST to UTC (universal coordinated time), which
        would be noticeable in the timestamps reported back to members after metadata
        deposits</li>\n<li>Our IP address became dynamic and is no longer static.
        If members had hardcoded our previous IP static address to connect to our
        services, that would no longer work.</li>\n<li>We previously allowed connections
        using the HTTP/1.0 protocol, but now require HTTP/1.1.\nLikewise, we previously
        allowed TLS version 1.1, but now require at least version 1.2. Older ciphers
        will not work. A list of accepted ciphers can be found on <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/describe-ssl-policies.html#tls-security-policies\"
        target=\"_blank\">this page</a> for \"ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS13-1-2-2021-06\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h3
        id=\"how-it-went-and-whats-next\">How it went and what''s next</h3>\n<p>We
        still have more to do, with both expected and unexpected issues arising from
        the migration. There are a couple of functions that still route through the
        data centre, configuration changes to wrangle, and processes to iron out,
        so we''ll be keeping that open for another couple of months.</p>\n<p>Those
        were the known issues\u2026</p>\n<p>\u2026we also uncovered a few bugs along
        the way, and we''ve been reporting those (and our progress toward fixing them)
        on our status page. <a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/history\" target=\"_blank\">See
        history</a>.</p>\n<p>A few diligent members also alerted us to problems they
        were having. In some cases, we could tell why, and in many cases, their systems
        needed to be upgraded to work with ours. Thanks go to mEDRA, Spandidos Publications,
        and Stichting SciPost who helped us identify gaps that resulted in configuration
        improvements and lessons learned (that we then shared with other members).</p>\n<p>There
        were three issues that we were contacted about more than others:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a
        href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/scr3rtr8f4pm\" target=\"_blank\">Delayed
        delivery of notification emails</a> which is partly due to the volume of backlogged
        notification emails in the system.\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly solved: We have repaired
        delivery of notification emails for all metadata deposits and are working
        on a fix for the delivery of messages associated with very large queries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a
        href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/nyr3g5b3h05v\" target=\"_blank\">A
        small percentage of registered records not being indexed in the REST API</a>
        - this can cause downstream issues for a number of other services (e.g., Crossref
        metadata search - search.crossref.org, Participation Reports, ORCID auto-update,
        and for external services that make use of the metadata from our REST API).\n<ul>\n<li>Mostly
        solved: All records in July are now indexed in the REST API, albeit we have
        new reports of a few records missing in the last week, which we are actively
        investigating.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://status.crossref.org/incidents/9cdhzzvt1xt3\"
        target=\"_blank\">Delayed delivery of July''s resolution reports</a>.\n<ul>\n<li>Solved
        - not only has July''s resolution report run completed, but we also completed
        August''s ahead of schedule.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This migration
        was a significant effort, and 2025''s top priority project for the Open and
        Sustainable Operations (OSO) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.64000/4s2ee-wkr84\"

        toward making Crossref infrastructure more robust, reliable, and future-proof.
        And judging by the messages of support we received, you are too! Onwards to
