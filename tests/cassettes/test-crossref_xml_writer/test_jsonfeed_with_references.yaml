        software is a key part of most research today. As University of Manchester
        Professor Carole Goble has said, \"software is the ubiquitous instrument of
        science.\" Creating and maintaining research software is a human effort, and
        as Yanina Bellina, rOpenSci Community Manager, has said, \"the work of the
        people who develop and maintain research software is often hidden and needs
        to be recognized.\"</p><p>Studies of researchers at leading UK universities

        of postdoctoral researchers in the US [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5328442\">2</a>]
        have found that over 90% use research software, over 65% see research software
        as fundamental to their research, and 25-55% develop software as part of the
        research.</p><p>Research software, being ubiquitous, is difficult to concisely
        define. One recent attempt [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.54900/9akm9y5-5ject5y\">3</a>]
        says that research software:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img

        research software is developed, however, users can find bugs, users can want
        new features, and the underlying hardware and software on which the software
        is built (e.g., libraries, OS) can change. The research software needs to
        be manually maintained in response to these issues. In other words, research
        software is not a one-time investment, but requires ongoing maintenance.</p><p>Research
        software sustainability can be defined as occurring when the resources (people,
        funding, etc.) to enable maintenance are gathered and applied. </p><p>This
        is different from challenges for publications and datasets because while research
        software can similarly be a research result and research product, it has properties
        that differ from papers and datasets, and needs different policies and funding
        models.</p><h2 id=\"research-software-alliance-resa\">Research Software Alliance
        (ReSA)</h2><p>In response to these facts, the <a href=\"http://www.researchsoft.org/\">Research

        Research Data Commons (ARDC)</a>, the <a href=\"https://alliancecan.ca/en\">Digital
        Research Alliance of Canada</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/\">National
        Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.esciencecenter.nl/\">Netherlands
        eScience Center</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.software.ac.uk/\">Software
        Sustainability Institute (SSI)</a> to help these organisations and other stakeholders
        collaborate on the advancement of the research software ecosystem. </p><p>ReSA''s
        vision is that research software and those who develop and maintain it are
        recognised and valued as fundamental and vital to research worldwide, while
        its mission is to advance the research software ecosystem by collaborating
        with key influencers and decision makers.</p><p>ReSA is a fiscally-sponsored
        project of <a href=\"https://www.codeforsociety.org/\">Code for Science &amp;
        Society</a>, has part time <a href=\"https://www.researchsoft.org/people/\">staff

        committee</a> chaired by Daniel S. Katz, Chief Scientist at NCSA at the University

        Forum</a></h3><p>The ReSA Funders Forum, a collaboration of 30+ research software
        funding organisations, started in 2022. The organisations represented are
        currently about 2/3 government, 1/4 philanthropic, and 1/12 industry. Geographically,
        41% are in Europe, 34% in North America, 17% in Australasia, and 4% each in
        African and South America.</p><p>The Funders Forum provides a formal mechanism
        for funders to share funding practices, address research software community
        challenges, facilitate networks and collaboration, and consider how to achieve
        long-term sustainability for research software. It meets monthly, with each
        meeting repeating twice in a day to allow those in different time zones to
        participate each time, and shifting in time from month to month to allow different
        sets of participants to form each time. Each meeting includes short presentations
        from funders on their new activities, and a discussion topic that is either
        led by ReSA or by a funder, such as on diversity, equity, and inclusion in
        research software, open source program offices, collaboration mechanisms,
        and landscape analysis. The Funder Forums also has working groups in which
        more focused activities can occur, such as planning for a multi-organisational
        funding call and defining policies around FAIR for research software.</p><p>Discussions
        in the ReSA steering committee and the funders forum led ReSA and the Netherlands
        eScience Center to co-convene the \u201c<a href=\"https://future-of-research-software.org/\">International
        Funders Workshop: The Future of Research Software</a>\u201d in Amsterdam in
        November 2022, with representation from 45 funding organisations (those who

        who develop and maintain it). </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img
