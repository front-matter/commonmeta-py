        diverse and complex data that demand increasingly complex analysis models.
        The PEcAn project works to develop this ability.</h4><p>In this next interview,
        we will go into the science of climate change, and explore where data analysis
        and ecosystem modeling tools are developed. That is the main objective of
        the <a href=\"https://pecanproject.github.io/\">PEcAn project</a>, where they
        collaboratively seek new ways to collect and synthesize data and develop accessible
        tools to perform these tasks in a reproducible way.</p><p>Our discussion was
        attended by Rob Kooper, Chris Black, Eric Scott, Michael C. Dietze, and David
        LeBauer. All members of the PEcAn project with the same goal: to find more
        and better ways to integrate the enormous amount of existing data on climate
        change.</p><figure><img alt=\"Profile photos of David LeBauer, Michael C.

        <p><center><strong>David LeBauer, Michael C. Dietze, Rob Kooper, Eric Scott,
        and Chris Black</strong></center></p> </figcaption></figure><p>According to
        Michael C. Dietze\u2019s own account, the project <em>\u201cis like a kind
        of computerized data modeling system. It\u2019s a set of tools that facilitate
        the combination of process and data models, with a special focus on ecological
        models.\u201d</em></p><p>In the project description, the concept of community
        quickly comes up. They have a large network of people distributed geographically
        and strategically, allowing them to reach more students involved in different
        parts of the process and in different projects. Thus, they can share work
        with many people simultaneously, have a significant number of collaborators
        and disseminate knowledge beyond academic boundaries because, as Rob explains,
        those students will continue their developments in other places where they
        are likely to bring their tools and data packages. In these connections and
        collaborative work lies much of the strength of the PEcAn Project.</p><p>An
        example of this practice is the project they are developing with Brooklyn
        National Laboratory, where they are working on NASA carbon monitoring that
        uses a data simulation system. In this case, there are both PhD students and
        Post Doctoral Researchers working on the project.</p><h2 id=\"a-tree-that-keeps-growing\"><a

        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>A tree that keeps growing</h2><p>In this work
        structure, one of the main objectives is to become a kind of \u201cHacker\u201d
        that solves problems in a more general sense that can then be applied in other
        contexts and in other areas. According to Rob, knowledge can be sustained
        and grow thanks to the research developed across multiple institutions including
        University of Illinois, Boston University, University of Arizona, University
        of Wisconsin and Brookhaven National Laboratory.</p><p>Working with Google
        Summer of Code, which has helped with developing and promoting an ecosystem
        of modeling tools, Chris explains that part of the success is that it is not
        just one university doing research but a large team of people all over the
        world working together. Although it takes longer, the result is used by a
        much wider community.</p><h2 id=\"doing-more-in-less-time-with-standards\"><a

        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>Doing more in less time with standards</h2><p>During
        the talk, the team shared the work <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gcb.15409\">\u201cBeyond
        ecosystem modeling: A roadmap to communitycyberinfrastructure for ecological
        data-model integration\u201d</a> as an example, where they explain with a
        diagram how the PEcAn project makes the life of researchers who have to do
        multi-model analysis \u201c352\u201d times easier.</p><figure><img alt=\"A
        flow diagram showing the standards approach for reducing redundant work when
        adopting common formats. There are \u201c n\u201d data types that must be
        linked to \u201cm\u201d simulation models and \u201ck\u201d post-simulation
        analyses. In the top panel, the conventional approach where modeling teams
        work independently requires implementing n \u00d7 m different input and m
        \u00d7 k different output conversions. As data, models, and analyses are added,
        and effort scales quadratically. On the other hand, the bottom panel shows
        that by working as a community, and adopting common formats and shared analytical
        tools, the number of converters necessary to link models, data, and analyses
        reduces to an m + n and m + k problem, and scales linearly. \" src=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/06/06/r-universe-stars-4-en/diagram.png\"/><figcaption>

        project is an example of the standards approach for modeling.</strong></center></p>
        </figcaption></figure><p>By using standards and having packages that can solve
        the reading, embedding and writing of all the data involved in the process,
        researchers don\u2019t need to know how many different formats work, or communicate
        with many different research teams, in order to do this kind of work.</p><p>This
        allows an individual researcher to run a whole ensemble models. \u201cJust
        a couple of years ago analyzing multi-models was not something that was accessible
        to individual researchers\u201d Michael explains.</p><h2 id=\"the-r-universe-experience\"><a

        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>The R-Universe experience</h2><p>PEcAn packages
        are organized into different groups, such as basic packages, useful tools,
        and modules that include packages for data management and also packages to
        do statistical analysis on the inputs and outputs of the models.</p><p>One
        of the most important points of <a href=\"https://pecanproject.r-universe.dev/builds\">having
        all the packages in an orderly manner in the R-Universe</a> is to simplify
        the work of researchers. Having easy and organized access to these models
        saves years of work and resources.</p><p>In addition, with so many people
        working on the packages, errors are more likely to discovered. Although the
        team knows that the PEcAn project code is not bug-free, they have a better
        chance of finding and fixing bugs by having more eyes looking at the same
        thing.</p><p>In the following video, the team shares how they organize the
        packages in the R-Universe and the strengths of using this tool:</p> <div
