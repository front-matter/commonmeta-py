      DataCite in the European Commission-funded\n[THOR project](http://project-thor.eu/),
      which started in June, was to\ncontribute to a comparison of the ORCID and DataCite
      metadata standards.\nTogether with ORCID, CERN, the British Library and Dryad
      we looked at\nhow contributors, organizations and artefacts - and the relations\nbetween
      them - are described in the respective metadata schemata, and\nhow they are
      implemented in two example data repositories, [Archaeology\nData Service](http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/)
      and [Dryad Digital\nRepository](https://www.datadryad.org/).\n\nThe focus of
      our work was on identifying major gaps. Our report was\nfinished and made publicly
      available last week (Fenner et al.,\n[2015](https://blog.datacite.org/differences-between-orcid-and-datacite-metadata/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.30799)).\nThe
      key findings are summarized below:\n\n- Common Approach to Personal Names\n-
      Standardized Contributor Roles\n- Standardized Relation Types\n- Metadata for
      Organisations\n- Persistent Identifiers for Projects\n- Harmonization of ORCID
      and DataCite Metadata\n\n### Common Approach to Personal Names\n\nWhile a single
      input field for contributor names is common, separate\nfields for given and
      family names are required for [proper formatting of\ncitations](http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#names).\nAs
      long as citations to scholarly content rely on properly formatted\ntext rather
      than persistent identifiers, services holding bibliographic\ninformation have
      to support these separate fields. Further work is\nneeded to help with the transition
      to separate input fields for given\nand famliy names, and to handle contributors
      that are organizations or\ngroups of people.\n\n### Standardized Contributor
      Roles\n\nThe currently existing vocabularies for **contributor type** (DataCite)\nand
      **contributor role** (ORCID) provide a high-level description, but\nfall short
      when trying to describe the author/creator contribution in\nmore detail. [Project
      CRediT](http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT) is a\nmulti-stakeholder initiative that
      has developed a common vocabulary with\n14 different contributor roles, and
      this vocabulary can be used to\nprovide this detail, e.g. who provided resources
      such as reagents or\nsamples, who did the statistical analysis, or who contributed
      to the\nmethodology of a study.\n\nCRediT is complementary to existing contributor
      role vocabularies such\nas those by ORCID and DataCite. For contributor roles
      it is particularly\nimportant that the same vocabulary is used across stakeholders,
      so that\nthe roles described in the data center can be forwarded first to\nDataCite,
      then to ORCID, and then also to other places such as\ninstitutional repositories.\n\n###
      Standardized Relation Types\n\nCapturing relations between scholarly works such
      as datasets in a\nstandardized way is important, as these relations are used
      for citations\nand thus the basis for many indicators of scholarly impact. Currently\nused
      vocabularies for relation types between scholarly works, e.g. by\nCrossRef and
      DataCite, only partly overlap. In addition we see\ndifferences in community
      practices, e.g. some scholars but not others\nreserve the term citation for
      links between two scholarly articles. The\nterm data citation is sometimes used
      for all links from scholarly works\nto datasets, but other times reserved for
      formal citations appearing in\nreference lists.\n\n### Metadata for Organisations\n\nBoth
      ORCID and DataCite not only provide persistent identifiers for\npeople and data,
      but they also collect metadata around these persistent\nidentifiers, in particular
      links to other identifiers. The use of\npersistent identifiers for organizations
      lags behind the use of\npersistent identifiers for research outputs and people,
      and more work is\nneeded.\n\n### Persistent Identifiers for Projects\n\nResearch
      projects are collaborative activities among contributors that\nmay change over
      time. Projects have a start and end date and are often\nfunded by a grant. The
      existing persistent identifier (PID)\ninfrastructure does support artefacts,
      contributors and organisations,\nbut there is no first-class PID support for
      projects. This creates a\nmajor gap that becomes obvious when we try to describe
      the relationships\nbetween funders, contributors and research outputs.\n\nBoth
      the ORCID and DataCite metadata support funding information, but\nonly as direct
      links to contributors or research outputs, respectively.\nThis not only makes
      it difficult to exchange funding information between\nDataCite and ORCID, but
      also fails to adequately model the sometimes\ncomplex relationships, e.g. when
      multiple funders and grants were\ninvolved in supporting a research output.
      We therefore not only need\npersistent identifiers for projects, but also infrastructure
      for\ncollecting and aggregating links to contributors and artefacts.\n\n###
      Harmonization of ORCID and DataCite Metadata\n\nWe identified significant differences
      between the ORCID and DataCite\nmetadata schema, and these differences hinder
      the flow of information\nbetween the two services. Several different approaches
      to overcome these\ndifferences are conceivable:\n\n1.  only use a common subset,
      relying on linked persistent identifiers\n    to get the full metadata\n2.  harmonize
      the ORCID and DataCite metadata schemata\n3.  common API exchange formats for
      metadata\n\nThe first approach is the linked open data approach, and was designed\nspecifically
      for scenarios like this. One limitation is that it requires\npersistent identifiers
      for all relevant attributes (e.g. for every\ncreator/contributor in the DataCite
      metadata). One major objective for\nTHOR is therefore to increase the use of
      persistent identifiers, both by\nTHOR partners, and by the community at large.\n\nA
      common metadata schema between ORCID and DataCite is neither feasible\nnor necessarily
      needed. In addition, we have to also consider\ninteroperability with other metadata
      standards (e.g. CASRAI, OpenAIRE,\nCOAR), and with other artifacts, such as
      those having CrossRef DOIs.\nWhat is more realistic is harmonization across
      a limited set essential\nmetadata.\n\nThe third approach to improve interoperability
      uses a common API format\nthat includes all the metadata that need to be exchanged,
      but doesn''t\nrequire the metadata schema itself to change. This approach was
      [taken\nby DataCite and CrossRef a few years\nago](https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-and-datacite-unify-support-for-http-content-negotiation/)\nto
      provide metadata for DOIs in a consistent way despite significant\ndifferences
      in the CrossRef and DataCite metadata schema. Using HTTP\ncontent negotiation,
      metadata are provided in a variety of formats.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis
