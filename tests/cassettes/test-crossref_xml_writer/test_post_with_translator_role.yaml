        (like my scripts) I can say that learning R was the <strong>best decision
        I made in my professional career.</strong></p><p>R Since then it has become
        a fundamental tool in my daily life: As <a href=\"https://tuqmano.github.io/geo_utdt/\">academic</a>
        in my work as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/menta_arg\">consultant and analyst</a>;
        in my role <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/es/blog/2022/11/23/r-universe-stars-1-es/\">as
        a public servant</a>; in my spare time, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TuQmano/status/1426882408574595072\">as
        a hobby</a>; and in my current role, coordinating the Data team at <a href=\"https://fund.ar/\">Fundar</a>,
        a think tank that studies and formulates public policies for the sustainable
        and inclusive development of Argentina.</p><p>Of all the qualities that R
        has, the <strong>community</strong> was the determining factor in my journey
        with this programming language.</p><p>While I was finishing the first step
        of the thesis, I found out about the organization of the first <a href=\"https://latinr.org/\">Latin
        American Conference on R for R&amp;D (LatinR)</a> to which I owe my second
        (and third\u2026 and umpteenth) step in my relationship with R. In the first
        conference I presented use cases for political analyses from R, implementing
        <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327382101_Geofaceting_Argentina_LatinR_2018\">grids
        from Argentina to use with ggplot as if they were maps with geofacet</a>.
        In the second conference, we presented the <em>Shiny App</em> <a href=\"http://inteligenciaelectoral.mentacomunicacion.com.ar/\">Electoral
        Intelligence</a> for the analysis of electoral results in Argentina and I
        was able to participate in the <em>Package Development</em> workshop with
        <a href=\"https://hadley.nz/\">Hadley Wickham</a>. This was the ideal starting
        point to get started with the idea of packaging code myself.</p><figure class=\"center\"><img

        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>The birth of polAr</h2><p>With the aim of presenting
        at the third LatinR conference, I developed a polished version of <a href=\"https://electorarg.github.io/geofaceteAR/\">geofacetAR</a>
        with functions to work with the design of grids as if they were maps of Argentina.</p><p>The
        Covid19 pandemic hit. Learning how to develop packages, in times of confinement
        and many hours in front of the computer, turned the electoral data processing
        work of my life as a political scientist and consultant into a new package:
        <a href=\"https://github.com/electorArg/polAr\">polAr</a>; that on May 16,
        2020 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CRANberriesFeed/status/1261597845808975872\">traveled
        to CRAN</a>.</p><h2 id=\"the-polar-universe\"><a class=\"anchor d-print-none\"
        href=\"https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/12/05/divide_and_you_will_win_from_polar_to_the_polarverse//#the-polar-universe\">
        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>The polAr Universe</h2><p>Although originally
        the package sought to facilitate access and tools for the analysis of electoral
        data in Argentina, over time, other workflows and data sources (geographic,
        presidential speeches, and legislative votes) were integrated, with an increase
        in dependencies and difficulty in managing more and more functions. This was
        a problematic issue that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvSv8StDa8&amp;t=10872s\">was
        discussed with colleagues in the Package Development panel during the third
        LatinR confernce (2020)</a>.</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvSv8StDa8&amp;t=10872s\"><img

        had reached 4000 downloads when I received an email from the CRAN team informing
        me that I had to fix a policy violation to prevent the package from being
        archived. DUnfortunately my submitted fix did not appear to correct the problem
        and the package was archived.</p><figure><a href=\"https://github.com/politicaargentina/polarverse\"><img

        the conversation at LatinR made me think about splitting polAr into multiple
        packages as a possibility, the CRAN archiving gave me the opportunity to do
        so. The decision was to generate independent workflows; a strategy that made
        it possible to move forward at different paces, making specific decisions
        for each topic, trying to address it at the same time as part of a whole,
        emulating the <em>Tidyverse</em> paradigm: a similar philosophy and grammar
        of operation for the <a href=\"https://tuqmano.ar/2021/06/05/de-polar-al-polarverse/\">collection
        of packages</a>. The goal was to improve the development of that which led
        to the archiving of polAr.</p><p>I presented \u201c<a href=\"https://github.com/TuQmano/latinr2021/blob/master/divide_reinaras/divide_reinaras.pdf\">Divide
        and Conquer: from {polAr} to the polarverse</a> at the fourth edition of LatinR,
        showcasing this new universe with five packages:</p><ol><li><p>\ud83d\udce6
        <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/opinAr\">opinAr</a>: provides
        access to data on public opinion and government in Argentina based on the
        Confidence in Government Index published monthly by the Universidad Torcuato
        Di Tella.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udce6 <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/electorAr\">electorAr</a>:
        facilitates access to electoral data for Argentina (for different levels and
        with different spatial aggregation) and functions to compute relevant indicators.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udce6
        <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/legislAr\">legislAr</a>:
        facilitates downloading disaggregated information of votes in the legislative
        chambers of Argentina, originating from the project <a href=\"https://andytow.com/scripts/disciplina/index-d.html\">Decade
        Voted</a> project by Andy Tow.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udce6 <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/discursAr\">discursAr</a>:
        is designed to obtain data on political speeches. In principle, it provides
        access to presidential speeches in legislative assemblies at the inauguration
        of ordinary sessions.</p></li><li><p>\ud83d\udce6 <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/geoAr\">geoAr</a>:
        allows access to data and tools for spatial workflows from within R. One <a
        href=\"https://github.com/TuQmano/latinr2023/blob/main/geoAr/geoAr.pdf\">paper</a>
        on the package was accepted for the <a href=\"https://latinr.org/\">sixth
        edition of LatinR conference (2023)</a>.</p></li></ol><p>In addition, we worked
        on an auxiliary library called <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/polArViz\">polarViz</a>
        to facilitate the visualization of the other packages, and a metapackage called
        <a href=\"https://politicaargentina.r-universe.dev/polArverse\">polArverse</a>that
        emulates the operation of tidyverse for loading the set of associated libraries.</p><h2

        I incorporated  the R-Universe into the workflow. It provides an autonomous

        <small>\ud83d\udd17</small></a>We continue to take important steps for our
        universe:</h3><p>First, we returned to CRAN! In February 2023, we shipped
        geoAr, which, as noted, provides access to and facilitates the processing
        of spatially relevant data. A version under development (accessible from the
        R-Universe) also allows you to interact with the <a href=\"https://georef-ar-api.readthedocs.io/es/latest/\">API
        of the Argentine Geographic Data Standardization Service (Servicio de Normalizaci\u00f3n
        de Datos Geogr\u00e1ficos de Argentina</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, I added
        a pending tool to the polAr toolbox to work with census data: <a href=\"https://github.com/PoliticaArgentina/censAr\">censAr</a>.
        The package, currently under development, is based on the code from <a href=\"https://docs.ropensci.org/censo2017/\">censo2017</a>
        developed by <a href=\"https://ropensci.org/author/pach%C3%A1-aka-mauricio-vargas-sep%C3%BAlveda/\">Mauricio

        as a work tool, in multiple facets: as an analyst, consultant and teacher.</p></li><li><p>The
        R community -  in particular all my experiences with <em>LatinR</em>- were
        a determining factor for my development. It certainly made the process much

        was a side project where I worked in my free time and without funding. It
        emerged almost playfully, as an experiment to learn how to develop software.
        We successfully published it in CRAN. We got frustrated and angry. We learned.
