        dir=\"ltr\">Classifying research publications into research topics or research
        areas is crucial for many bibliometric analyses. While there are lots of approaches
        for classifying publications, most of these approaches lack transparency.
        Although there are exceptions (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>), these approaches are typically based on data
        from proprietary sources or they rely on non-transparent algorithms.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">We introduce an open approach to the algorithmic classification
        of research publications. This approach builds on a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1\"
        target=\"_blank\">methodology we developed more than a decade ago</a>. While
        this methodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary sources,
        we now apply it to open data from <a href=\"https://openalex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAlex</a>.
        We make available a fully open classification of publications. The research
        areas in this classification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
        the classification is presented visually using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\"
        target=\"_blank\">VOSviewer Online software</a>. We also release open source
        software that enables anyone to reproduce and extend our work.<br/></p><h3>Building
        the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">We built <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
        target=\"_blank\">our classification</a> based on OpenAlex data, using the
        <a href=\"https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot\"
        target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a> released on November 21, 2023. Over the past
        years, our methodology has been used to create classifications based on Web
        of Science and Scopus data. These classifications are available in <a href=\"https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/\"
        target=\"_blank\">InCites</a> and <a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence\"
        target=\"_blank\">SciVal</a>, respectively. Compared to Web of Science and
        Scopus, OpenAlex has the benefit that its data is fully open and that it offers
        a broader coverage of the scholarly literature.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To build
        our classification, we used the so-called <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035\"
        target=\"_blank\">extended direct citation approach</a> in combination with
        the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
        algorithm</a>. The source code of the software we used is available <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Our classification covers the 71 million journal
        articles, proceedings papers, preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that
        were published between 2000 and 2023 and that are connected to each other
        by citation links. Based on 1715 million citation links, we built a three-level
        hierarchical classification. Each publication was assigned to a research area
        at each of the three levels of the classification. Research areas consist
        of publications that are relatively strongly connected by citation links and
        that can therefore be expected to be topically related. At each level of the
        classification, a publication was assigned to only one research area, which
        means research areas do not overlap.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Using the parameter
        values reported in Table 1, we obtained a classification that consists of
        4521 research areas at the lowest (most granular) level, 917 research areas
        at the middle level, and 20 research areas at the highest (least granular)
        level. We also algorithmically linked each research area in our classification
        to one or more of the following five broad main fields: biomedical and health
        sciences, life and earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
        sciences and engineering, and social sciences and humanities.</p><table style=\"width:400px;

        to build the classification.\n</span></p><p>\nGiven the huge size of the citation
        network based on which we built the classification, the process of building
        the classification was computationally demanding. We used a computer with
        200 GB internal memory. The process took about 70 hours on this computer.\n</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">Labeling the research areas in an algorithmically built publication
        classification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach introduced
        in our original methodology yields a list of five characteristic terms for
        each research area. While these terms usually give a reasonably good impression
        of the topics covered by a research area, our experience is that users often
        want to have a single term that summarizes what a research area is about.</p><p
        dir=\"ltr\">Large language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities
        to label research areas. We therefore used the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5\"
        target=\"_blank\">Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo LLM</a>, developed by OpenAI, to label
        the 4521 research areas at the lowest level in our classification. The source
        code of our software can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling\"
        target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For each research area, we provided
        the LLM with the titles of the 250 most cited publications in the area, along
        with the prompt shown in Box 1. Using this prompt, we asked the LLM to return
        a label for each research area, both a short one (max. three words) and a
        longer one (max. eight words). We also requested the LLM to provide a few
        sentences that summarize what the research area is about.</p><div style=\"padding:10px;
        background-color:#F5F5F5;\"><p style=\"font-size:14px;\">You will be provided
        with the titles of a representative sample of papers from a larger cluster

        Case), list of 10 ''keywords'' (ordered by relevance and format in Title Case),
        ''summary'' (few sentences), and ''wikipedia page'' (URL).<br/>\nDo not start
        short and long labels with the word \"The\".<br/>\nStart each summary with

        1. Prompt provided to the LLM.\n</span></p><p>Table 2 presents the results
        provided by the LLM for one of the 4521 research areas. The results show that
        this research area is about bibliometrics. Although we did not perform a systematic
        evaluation of the quality of the LLM results, our impression is that the results
        are a substantial improvement over the results obtained using our original
        methodology, or variants of that methodology. We also tried to use the LLM
        to label the research areas at the middle level and the highest level in our
        classification, but this did not yield satisfactory results.\n</p><table style=\"width:100%;\"><tbody><tr><td

        2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n</span></p><p>\nWhile
        the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such as GPT
        3.5 raises complex legal and ethical questions that require further consideration.
        Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We paid slightly less than USD
        50 to label 4521 research areas. We also considered the use of GPT 4, but
        this LLM is more expensive and did not seem to yield better results.\n</p><h3>Visualizing
        the classification</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">A powerful way to use our publication
        classification is to create interactive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents
        an example of such a landscape. It was created using the <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1\">VOSviewer
        Online software</a>. We used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas
        at the lowest level in our classification. Each bubble represents a research
        area. The larger the bubble, the larger the number of publications in the
        research area. The distance between bubbles approximately indicates the relatedness
        of research areas in terms of citation links. In general, the smaller the
        distance between two bubbles, the stronger the citation links between the
        two research areas. The color of a bubble shows the primary main field to
        which a research area belongs. For instance, research areas in the physical
        sciences and engineering (blue) are located on the left side of the landscape,
        while research areas in the social sciences and humanities (red) are located
        on the right side. Finally, for some bubbles, the landscape also shows the
        label obtained using our LLM-based labeling approach.</p><figure><img data-image=\"39511\"

        Figure 1 can be explored in more detail in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5\"
        target=\"_blank\">this interactive webtool</a>. The webtool enables zooming
        in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also possible to see the list
        of publications included in each research area.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To illustrate
        the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape to show the publication
        activity of our own institution, Leiden University. The landscape presented
        in Figure 2 is identical to the one in Figure 1, except that the color of
        a bubble now indicates the proportion of publications in a research area with
        authors affiliated with Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
        areas in which Leiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
        research area, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can
        be explored in <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x\" target=\"_blank\">our
        interactive webtool</a>. The webtool for instance reveals that Leiden University
        has 570 publications in the period 2000-2023 in the research area labeled
        \u2018Bibliometric Analysis\u2019. This is one of the research areas in the
        social sciences and humanities in which Leiden University has its strongest
        publication activity.</p><figure><img data-image=\"39523\" src=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"

        dir=\"ltr\">We have introduced an open approach for classifying research publications
        into research areas: Our approach relies on open data from OpenAlex, our software
        is open source, and our publication classification is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276\"
        target=\"_blank\">openly available</a>. The work presented in this blog post
        is part of an <a href=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts\"
        target=\"_blank\">ambitious agenda</a> we have at CWTS to move to fully open
        approaches to bibliometrics, and to openness of research information and research
        analytics more generally.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The publication classification
        discussed in this blog post is a crucial building block for the Open Edition
        of the <a href=\"https://www.leidenranking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leiden
        Ranking</a> that CWTS is going to release on January 30. The classification
        is also used by the OpenAlex team as a foundation for a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s\"
        target=\"_blank\">new topic classification for OpenAlex</a>. We hope our work
        will help to advance the transition to open approaches to bibliometrics!<br/></p><span
