        is the first in a <a\nhref=\"http://wp.me/p5O69U-aF\">series of posts</a></span><span\nstyle=\"font-weight:400;\">\u00a0describing
        how THOR partners have recently\nintegrated <a href=\"http://orcid.org/\">ORCID</a>
        in their disciplinary\ndata repositories. This post describes ORCID integration
        in <a\nhref=\"https://www.pangaea.de/\">PANGAEA</a>, the Data Publisher for
        Earth\n&amp; Environmental Science.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">PANGAEA
        is rolling out a new version\nof its website. Developers and designers are
        currently ironing out a few\nremaining open issues. The release is expected
        for autumn 2016. Among\nmajor improvements in search, design, and usability,
        a key new feature\nis the integration of ORCID.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The
        new feature enables existing\nPANGAEA users to connect their PANGAEA profile
        with their ORCID iD, as\ndemonstrated in the video below.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span
        class=\"embed-youtube\"\nstyle=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"></span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">With this connection, PANGAEA obtains\nthe </span><em><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">validated</span></em><span\nstyle=\"font-weight:400;\">
        ORCID iD of its users from ORCID. By\nconnecting their ORCID iD, users can
        also choose to sign in to PANGAEA\nusing ORCID, as an alternative to signing
        in using PANGAEA user\ncredentials. This can be handy when a user is already
        signed in to\nORCID, or it is quicker to recall ORCID credentials.</span></p>\n<p><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\">Obtaining the validated ORCID iDs of\nits users
        is significant for PANGAEA as, contrary to a researcher\u2019s\nname, the
        iD is unambiguous: two researchers with the same name can be\ndistinguished
        by their respective iDs. The iD is also persistent through\npossible changes
        in a person\u2019s name: the same researcher may change\nmarital status, or
        their name may appear in different permutations, at\ntimes appear with full
        name, initials for first name, and with or\nwithout middle name (initial).
        Furthermore, the iD is actionable and can\nbe used to discover information
        about the researcher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">For
        researchers, the greatest\nadvantage of connecting their ORCID iD to their
        PANGAEA profile is that\nPANGAEA can then record the relationships between
        dataset publication\nDOIs and contributor ORCID iDs. This information is then
        shared with the\nglobal network of PID infrastructures, and researchers benefit
        from\nautomated updates to their ORCID Record for data published at PANGAEA,\ngaining
        unambiguous attribution for published datasets and benefiting\nfrom greater
        credit for sharing data early.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Let\u2019s
        take a look at how the ORCID\nintegration in PANGAEA is making a difference
        to <a\nhref=\"https://www.marum.de/en/Alice_Lefebvre.html\">Dr Alice\nLefebvre</a>,
        <a href=\"https://www.marum.de/en/GLOMAR.html\">GLOMAR</a>\nAssociate Scientist
        at the <a\nhref=\"https://www.marum.de/en/index.html\">MARUM</a> Center for
        Marine\nEnvironmental Sciences of the <a\nhref=\"http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html\">University
        of Bremen</a>.\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Alice has
        recently joined ORCID and\ndecided to claim the 14 data publications deposited
        at PANGAEA that she\nhas authored. As a consequence, Alice gains a more complete
        <a\nhref=\"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9234-8279\">ORCID Record</a>, one that\ndoes
        not just include her journal article publications but also her\nauthorship
        in data publications </span><span\nstyle=\"font-weight:400;\">\u2212</span><span
        style=\"font-weight:400;\"> a\nrecord that better reflects her true contribution
        to the scientific\nrecord. Alice was also surprised to learn about <a\nhref=\"http://datacite.org\">DataCite</a>
        and the <a\nhref=\"http://search.datacite.org/contributors/0000-0002-9234-8279\">overview</a>\nDataCite
        provides about her contributions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">The
        upcoming release of the PANGAEA\nwebsite automates the sharing of information
        with the global network of\nPID infrastructures. Authors of datasets published
        at PANGAEA who have\nconnected their ORCID iD, like Alice, will benefit from
        a workflow that\nensures information appears automatically and accurately
        on their ORCID\nRecord.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This
        shows how far the integration\nbetween disciplinary repositories and the global
        network of PID\ninfrastructures has come over the past years, and how the
        persistent\nidentification of contributors and research artefacts together
        with\ninfrastructures that aggregate, process, and share information about\npersistently
        identified resources are driving and shaping 21st-century\nattribution, credit,
        communication, and measurement of scholarly\nactivity.</span></p>\n<p>**Want
