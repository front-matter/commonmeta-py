        spending on Closed Access content in university libraries in Germany has remained
        relatively stable, investments in Open Access have surged dramatically. Please
        note that not all universities reported all values consistently, making it
        impossible to quantify the trends with complete precision. However, clear
        trends can still be identified.<br>At the end of the post, you will also find
        a link to the Excel file I used for the analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s
        look at the numbers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spending on digital Closed Access
        content</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2018: \u20ac153,818,679</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2024:

        data on subscription licenses are recorded in field 151, where, <a href=\"https://service-wiki.hbz-nrw.de/spaces/DBS/pages/84541474/Frageb%C3%B6gen+f%C3%BCr+die+DBS+und+%C3%96BS?preview=/84541474/1089536355/WB_vorab_Stand-Dezember-2024_final.pdf\"

        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to the documentation</a>,
        the following values are collected:<br>&#8222;Digital / electronic media include
        the documents listed under (110) to (121) and (131) to (138). The expenditures
        for these media are to be reported here if they were incurred for the purchase
        or licensing of content, or for institutional shares in consortial and/or
        lump-sum agreements without an Open Access component. However, if the expenditures
        were related to Open Access publications, they are to be reported under (151.1)
        and (151.2). Fields (151.1) and (151.2) also include all expenditures arising
        from<strong> </strong>transformative agreements.&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spending
        on Open Access (OA)</strong><br>This includes Gold OA, transformative Hybrid
        OA, Diamond OA (consortially funded and outside the institution), and support
        for Open Access infrastructures (such as the <a href=\"https://www.bibliotheksstatistik.de/\"
        target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul
        class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2018: \u20ac6,213,409</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2024:
        \u20ac100,445,670<br><strong>= an increase of <strong>1,516.6</strong>%</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These
        data are recorded in field 151.1, which is defined in the documentation as
        follows:<br>&#8222;This includes expenditures for Open Access publications
        and transformation efforts not published at the institution itself<strong>
        </strong>(e.g., via a repository or institutionally operated publishing platforms):
        all expenditures for Gold or Hybrid APCs and BPCs (excluding printing, translation,
        and incidental costs), crowdfunding for journal or book packages (e.g., pledging
        via Knowledge Unlatched), Subscribe-to-Open models, Open Access consortia
        (e.g., SCOAP3, KOALA, PLOS Community Action Publishing). Also to be reported
        are expenditures for external Open Access / Open Science infrastructures (e.g.,
        DOAJ, arXiv, SciPost, Open Library of Humanities) that are not necessarily
        tied to specific publications, but excluding expenditures for Open Access
        / Open Science infrastructures operated by the institution itself. This category
        also includes all expenditures related to transformative agreements / publisher
        contracts with both subscription and Open Access components / Publish &amp;
        Read agreements (regardless of whether they involve hybrid or gold OA, and
        regardless of whether they include reading or publishing fees). Transformative
        agreements include all contracts listed in the<strong> </strong>ESAC Transformative
        Agreement Registry<strong> </strong>(<a>https://esac-initiative.org/about/transformative-agreements/agreement-registry</a>)
        under which expenditures were incurred in the reporting year, as well as other
        comparable agreements with an OA component.&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2024,
        a new field 151.2 has also included the following expenditures, which I am
        not analyzing here in order to maintain comparability across the time series:
        &#8222;This question is a subset of question 151.1. It does NOT refer to question
        151. This includes all expenditures related to DEAL agreements that are invoiced
        by the DEAL consortium office (MPDL Services), including costs for Gold Open
        Access, service fees, and VAT. Expenditures from all other transformative
        agreements are recorded under field (151.1).&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,
        this sharp rise in Open Access spending must be interpreted in context. While
        the increase in subscription (Closed Access) costs has been moderate, the
        explosion in OA-related expenditures is closely tied to transformative agreements,
        fueled by the first DEAL agreements (the first one with Wiley started in 2019),
        followed by others with the same and other publishers. These high-volume contracts
        shifted large parts of the cost from the Closed Access side to the Open Access
        side of the accounting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the graph below shows, Open Access
        expenditures rose sharply in 2024,<a href=\"https://pulse49.com/2023/12/28/the-german-deal-contracts/\"
        data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7136\"> most likely due to the renewal of the
        DEAL agreements with Springer Nature and Wiley, and especially the conclusion
        of the contract with Elsevier</a>, which marked the end of the boycott by
        German universities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img

        development illustrates a major transformation in scholarly publishing: Open
        Access is no longer a peripheral issue. It has become a central, structured
        element in the financial and strategic planning of academic libraries in Germany.
        Nevertheless, Closed Access expenditures still significantly outweigh Open
        Access expenditures in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would have been interesting
        to analyze the full-time series starting in 2016 to explore the extent to
        which the Elsevier boycott, initiated in 2016 with the first contract cancellations
        and by 2018 embraced by nearly all universities, affected Closed Access expenditures.
        However, querying the database for this period was not straightforward, so
        I am now providing the figures for Closed Access subscriptions for the years
        2015\u20132017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the DBS data, the expenditures
        reported in this field changed little between 2015 and 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul
        class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2015: \u20ac144,764,563.00 </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2016:
        \u20ac159,736,477.00</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: \u20ac149,876,569.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As
        mentioned above, the value in 2018 was \u20ac153,818,679, indicating that
        the Elsevier boycott had no significant impact on subscription expenditures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Original
