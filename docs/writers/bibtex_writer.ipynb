Because BibTex has been around for more than 30 years, there are many flavours of it, including the list of supported types and the fields that are included. We try to align with the fields supported by Zotero, which is a popular reference manager. We for example include the `abstract`, `copyright` and `language` fields."

      "    abstract = {Among various advantages, their small size makes model organisms preferred subjects of investigation. Yet, even in model systems detailed analysis of numerous developmental processes at cellular level is severely hampered by their scale. For instance, secondary growth of Arabidopsis hypocotyls creates a radial pattern of highly specialized tissues that comprises several thousand cells starting from a few dozen. This dynamic process is difficult to follow because of its scale and because it can only be investigated invasively, precluding comprehensive understanding of the cell proliferation, differentiation, and patterning events involved. To overcome such limitation, we established an automated quantitative histology approach. We acquired hypocotyl cross-sections from tiled high-resolution images and extracted their information content using custom high-throughput image processing and segmentation. Coupled with automated cell type recognition through machine learning, we could establish a cellular resolution atlas that reveals vascular morphodynamics during secondary growth, for example equidistant phloem pole formation.},\n",

Our goal was to create a baseline scan for future comparison, to inform future repairs, to compare to her builders drawings, and to facilitate interpretation and research. USS Pampanito made six patrols in the Pacific during World War II during which she sank six Imperial Japanese ships and damaged four others. Operated by the Maritime Park Association, Pampanito hosts over 100,000 visitors a year and is one of the most popular historic vessels in the country. In addition to day time visitors, over 1,500 kids a year participate in Pampanito's educational day and overnight programs. Pampanito is a National Historic Landmark.
